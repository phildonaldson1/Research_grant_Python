       "    'description': \"Receptors form a basic intermediary as the acceptor site for signals that are transmitted between the cells that make up our body. Modulation of receptors, therefore, forms a key target in our ability to treat disease. The largest class of receptors is the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which transmit signals within a cell via proteins called G proteins. GPCRs form between 1 and 5% of the entire repertoire of human genes. One group of GPCRs provide the target for small protein molecules that cirulate through the body. One such circulating molecule is calcitonin, a peptide that plays an important role in maintaining circulating calcium levels in the body, which is essential for proper maintenance of the skeleton. As a consequence of this action, calcitonin is an important clinically used tool in the treatment of bone disease such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease. Due to the molecular nature of calcitonin and its receptors (and other related receptors) that have a broad, complex mechanism of interaction, we have very little definitive information on how calcitonin interfaces with its receptor to signal to target cells. The current project utilises a novel method of permanently linking calcitonin to its receptor, allowing identification of how the two components come together. Furthermore, the project will explore the functional consequence of naturally occuring genetic variation (genotype) and also examine whether the occurence of specific calcitonin receptor genotype is correlated with disease markers for osteoporosis and obesity. This information provides important fundamentals for understanding how this and related receptors work and the potential for rational design of improved theraupeutic tools.\",\n",

They function as master regulators of many biological processes and as such play an important role in a wide spectrum of diseases. Anti-inflammatory cytokines attenuate the potentially destructive force of other cytokines and the immune system as a whole, and are therefore coveted as drug targets. We discovered the formidable anti-inflammatory properties of IL-37 and will now explore how these activites can be utilised in clinical medicine.',\n",

These cells develop in the thymus, where they learn to distinguish between foreign invaders and self tissue, before emigrating to other organs. The regulation of this process is important to maintain a pool of T lymphocytes in the body. It is important that T lymphocytes do not respond against self tissue, as this can lead to a Oself destructO disease called autoimmunity. Since these developing T lymphocytes will not see all kinds of self tissue while in the thymus, we propose that their education to prevent self-tissue reactivity may continue for some time after they leave the thymus.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Over thirty different areas, comprising nearly half the primate cerebral cortex, are involved in processing visual information. From the anatomical viewpoint, each of these areas should be capable of receiving visual information independently, through parallel anatomical channels involving the brainstem. Yet, it has been observed that lesion of one particular area (the primary visual area, V1) results in loss of vision. This raises several questions. What type of visual information is carried by the parallel pathways to the other visual areas? Why aren t these other areas capable of sustaining vision without V1? Do V1 lesions trigger changes in the adult brain, which affect the other visual areas? As a step towards answering these questions, we will study the neural pathways that convey visual information directly to the middle temporal area (MT). MT is one of the best-characterised visual areas, and the anatomy of its neural inputs is well known, facilitating the interpretation of the results. We will investigate the type of visual information being sent to MT after lesions of V1, as well as the changes in the electrical responses of MT cells which result from this type of condition. This is a basic science study, the primary benefit of which will be advancement of knowledge on the mechanisms that underlie visual processing in normal and pathological situations. However, this type of work may also lay the groundwork for developments in areas of applied research. These may include medicine (e.g. the design of better rehabilitation strategies for people with brain damage), robotics- artificial intelligence (e.g. the development of more robust artificial systems capable of vision), and cognitive sciences (e.g. a better understanding of factors that limit human responses to visual stimuli).',\n",

       "    'description': 'It is well known that stress can impair reproduction in humans and animals but it is not understood how this occurs. Consequently there are no therapies available to overcome the detrimental effects of stress on reproduction. Stress can take many forms, such as psychological stress, surgical trauma, strenuous exercise, undernutrition, all of which may inhibit reproduction. We now know that males and females respond differently to stress and we have shown that stress is also likely to have different effects on reproduction in males and females. In this project we aim to determine how stress impairs reproduction in males and females. A major effect of stress appears to be to inhibit the secretion of a substance produced by the brain that is necessary for the regulation of reproduction. This substance is called gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) and it acts on a small gland at the base of the brain to cause the release of hormones that are essential for reproduction in both males and females. It is also possible that stress may inhibit the actions of GnRH. Our research suggests that there may be differences between males and females in the extent to which stress inhibits the secretion of GnRH from the brain and its actions to cause the release of other reproductive hormones. In this project we will determine how stress acts in the brain to affect the secretion and actions of GnRH in males and females. Our research will make a major contribution to our knowledge of the way that stress inhibits reproduction in males and females. This information is essential in order to develop specific remedies to overcome reproductive disorders caused by stress and to improve reproductive health in both sexes.',\n",

       "    'description': 'It is a common experience for objects being carried to feel heavier and tasks needing muscular effort to become more difficult as one becomes tired and the muscles fatigue during exertion. The sensation of muscle force depends on two factors. One, a sense of the effort required to perform a task, is generated in the central nervous system and. The other, a sense of the force actually developed by the muscles, is generated in the muscles themselves by signals from sensory receptors called Golgi tendon organs. The sensation of muscle force and the heaviness of objects results from a combination of both senses, but the contribution of each is unknown. The aim of the project is to determine whether the disturbance of force sense in fatigued muscles results from changes in the way tendon organs signal the actual force developed by the muscles. This will be important for understanding how force sense is disturbed following exercise and in disease states, and for understanding the normal way muscle force is sensed in everyday situations. Disturbances of force sense after exercise will be documented in human subjects by asking them to generate what they perceive to be equal forces in both arms or legs, before and after one limb only is exercised. Errors in force estimation will show up as mismatches between the two limbs. The difficulty with human experiments is that the signals generated by tendon organs cannot be measured directly, but only inferred, perhaps wrongly. This difficulty will be overcome by measuring tendon organ activity directly in anaesthetised animals, where the muscles will be electrically stimulated to perform exercise similar to that in the human experiments. A change in tendon organ signalling will be taken to mean that similar changes in humans could be responsible for disturbances of force sense. In further experiments, the mechanism of the changes will be explored.',\n",

Even in Australia, these bacteria, which may be food borne, are occasionally responsible for life threatening infections. In this study, we will investigate the contribution to diarrhoeal disease of large fragments of foreign DNA which have been recently acquired by these bacteria. We will characterise several of these elements in detail, identifying novel virulence determinants and toxins in the process. We will also explore the means by which these packages of nasty DNA transfer between bacteria and investigate their potential to give rise to new, more virulent strains of bacteria. This study is particularly significant because it will lead to an improved understanding of how bacteria cause disease and may help to guide us in developing better strategies for the prevention of bacterial diarrhoea. Specifically, the work done on characterising large clusters of virulence genes will allow us to construct safer bacterial vaccines and we expect that in the future this knowledge will contribute to the development of new and better diagnostic and therapeutic agents against these harmful bacteria.',\n",

       "    'description': \"For over a decade, hospitals in the American state of New York have been collecting information about the mortality rates of surgeons conducting Coronary Artery Bypass Grafts, and making this information available to patients. The United Kingdom is set to make these and other performance indicators on the ability of surgeons ('report cards') available from 2004. There are good reasons to think a similar system may be introduced in Australia in the near future. Patients can use the information contained in report cards when deciding whether or not to consent to have a particular surgeon conduct an operation on them. Contemporary bioethicists stress the importance of a proper informed consent process in medicine. This is a process in which a doctor advises a patient of relevant information and ensures that the patient comprehends that information, before the patient consents to an operation. Currently report cards in America are publicly disseminated on the internet, however there is no systematic attempt to incorporate the information contained in report cards into the informed consent process. We do not know if patients understand the information they are given, or if they incorporate it into their decision making procedures appropriately. In our study we will consider how information that is contained in report cards could best be used in the informed consent process. We will keep in mind the importance of helping patients to make their own informed decisions to consent to operations, the importance of respecting the professional integrity of surgeons and the importance of providing the best possible standard of care for patients. The result of our study will be a revised model of the informed consent process that incorporates report cards in an ethically acceptable way.\",\n",

       "    'description': 'Metastatic disease, malignant melanoma in particular, is a health issue of considerable global importance with 1,000 fatal melanoma cases- year in Australia alone. While progress has been made on prevention and early diagnosis, no curative treatment exists for stage IV melanoma. Tumour progression and the acquisition of metastatic competence primarily reflect dysregulation of cell adhesion and cell motility rather than proliferation and survival. In this context, Eph receptor tyrosine kinases (Ephs) and their membrane-bound ephrin ligands are crucial mediators of cell adhesion and motility and are notably overexpressed in metastatic tumours rather than primary (benign) lesions5. Our laboratories were the first to identify EphA3 7, and one of the first to isolate its ligand, ephrin-A5. EphA3 was isolated from acute lymphoblastoid leukemia and malignant melanoma patients, where increasing expression levels correlate with metastatic progression. Soluble, non-clustered forms of Ephs and ephrins are effective inhibitors of Eph activity 3 and provide opportunities to generate specific drugs for cancer therapy. We now propose a research and development program for the development of EphA3-specific drugs and their production for pre-clinical and clinical evaluation for placement onto a national and international market.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Osteoarthritis (OA) has the largest impact of any chronic disease on burden of disease borne in later life. This has been acknowledged by its listing as the 7th health priority in Australia. Knee OA is the most common reason for a joint replacement, thus imposing a huge financial burden to the community. Treatments which slow-prevent OA progressioning are limited and so prevention must play a key role. Obesity is the most significant, potentially modifiable risk factor for knee OA. The combination of the current epidemic of obesity in Western countries and the aging of the population is likely to have a synergistic effect on the prevalence and incidence of knee OA. Despite the consistent relationship between obesity and OA, little work has been done on the relationship between obesity and biomechanical factors such as knee angle and muscle mass and how these may interact with obesity and weight loss in modifying the risk of knee OA. It may be that weight loss programs could be more effective at reducing the risk of OA if they are combined with programs aimed at correcting muscle weakness and malalignment. This has the potential to promote a better quality of life as people age and to reduce the economic burden of knee OA in the community.',\n",

       "    'description': \"Approximately 9.7% of the adult population have an anxiety disorder with one of the more common, panic disorder, often with agoraphobia, afflicting 2.4% of the community. Around 8% of patients consulting a GP also have panic disorder (PD). A further 10% of the community experience spontaneous panic, but do not have full PD (termed non-clinical panic). People with PD frequently experience clinical depression, about 15% abuse alcohol and non-prescription drugs and PD is associated with an increased risk of suicide. Over time people with PD appear to have an increased risk of heart problems. They also have substantial financial burdens through multiple attendances at doctors' rooms and through restricted employment opportunities. Only just over one in four people with an anxiety disorder consults a health professional for their problems, with most going to their GP. It has been estimated that less than 10% of these people seek the services of a mental health specialist such as a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist. Therefore because of blocks to do with access, cost or embarrassment, many people with mental health problems do not seek face-to-face specialised mental health treatment. People in rural and regional Australia are particularly disadvantaged by limited access to these specialists. We have developed an internet-based treatment program on panic and anxiety for people in the community, and particularly in regional Australia. Early evaluation of this program has found it is more effective than other types of therapist-assisted self-help treatment. The aim of this research project is to compare it to best-practice face-to-face psychological and pharmacological treatment for PD. If the effectiveness of our internet-based treatment is comparable to best-practice face-to-face treatment, its availability will assist the many Australians who suffer from debilitating panic but who are unable to access specialised mental health assistance.\",\n",

       "    'description': 'Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a common genetic condition that causes fluid filled cysts to form in the kidney. In many cases, these cysts lead to kidney failure. Once the kidneys fail irreversibly, the only treatments available are dialysis and kidney transplantation. Dialysis to remove waste products from the blood is time consuming and does not completely replace all functions of the kidney. Kidney transplantation is limited by the availability of donor organs. At present, there are no reliable ways to prevent the onset or slow the progression of PKD. The kidney consists of a complex system of tubules and ducts. PKD causes the cells that make up these tubules and ducts to grow uncontrollably and form cysts. We are using mice to study how mutations affect the mechanisms that control cell growth in the kidney and cause PKD. Bone marrow cells can move to the kidney and repair it after damage. We will test if bone marrow cells carrying a PKD mutation can cause PKD when transplanted into a healthy mouse. This will help us learn how mutations cause PKD in humans. We will also see if normal bone marrow can prevent disease when transplanted into a mutant mouse that spontaneously develops PKD. This experiment may lay the basis for a way to treat human PKD.',\n",

Two receptors in the brain, the adenosine A1 (A1AR) and metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu5) are suggested to be promising new drug targets for dementia. In order to better develop drugs that target these receptors, we will develop a better understanding of activity of these receptors under conditions of health and disease.\",\n",

       "    'description': \"Sepsis kills more people per year than the cancers of the breast, colon, prostate and pancreas combined. Sepsis occurs in 1 of 50 hospital admissions and is the leading cause of death n intensive care units. The instance of sepsis has doubled in the last decade and is expected to increase. One of the major causes of sepsis si lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the main constituent of gram-negative bacteria's cell wall, and the prototypic inducer of the pro-inflammatory response of the innate immune system. Dysregulation of the pro-inflammatory response can lead to sepsis. Recently, the mammalian receptor for LPS was found to be Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, the activation of which activates a signal transduction pathway that initiates the pro-inflammatory response. We have previously shown a key role for an adapter protein called Mal in mediating signal transduction pathways upon activation of TLR-4. Interaction of Mal with a key signal transduction mediator called TRAF6 has been shown to induce the activation of the pro-inflammatory response. Furthermore, Mal has been found to undergo degradation which may indicate a means of regulating the continued activation of the pro-inflammatory pathway. This research program will investigate the role of Mal in mediating signal transduction in TLR activated macrophages, key responsive cells of the innate immune system to microbial infection. A greater understanding of these processes will assist in the development of therapeutics to alleviate the consequences of microbial-induced inflammation, including chronic inflammatory diseases and sepsis.\",\n",

       "    'description': \"Vascular smooth muscle can produce strong constrictions or spasms that can severely limit blood flow. Disorders arising from such spasms include sudden death, neurological deficits, visual and hearing loss or impairment, Raynaud's phenomenon (painful episodic contraction of the fingers and toes) and intestinal necrosis. Common mechanisms are likely to underlie the spasms associated with these disparate disorders. In a recent electrophysiological study of vascular smooth muscle, we discovered a novel membrane current which we refer to as the plateau current. This current has a strong depolarizing influence that is likely to make a major contribution to the spasms, particularly in arterioles and small arteries which are more dependent on depolarization for contraction. Block of this current is expected to minimize the depolarization and therefore prevent or ameliorate spasm of the vessels. Thus the plateau current represents a new field of therapeutic potential for addressing vascular problems that have significant health implications. However, therapeutic manipulation of the current requires knowledge of its properties. In this project we will determine the biophysical and pharmacological properties of this current using voltage-clamp techniques. We will then use this information to assess its functional significance by recording membrane potential with intracellular microelectrodes simultaneously with contractile activity. We will also compare small vessels obtained from volunteers with or without the vasospastic disorder of Raynaud's phenomenon. Our previous work using these techniques was described in J Physiol as a microelectrode, patch clamp and myograph study of the highest quality and of supreme technical difficulty and scored a Top-Ten hit rate. Since we are the only ones to record the plateau current, we are in a unique position to make significant progress to our understanding of contraction, including spasm, in small blood vessels.\",\n",

       "    'description': 'Skeletal muscle responds to exercise or mechanical load, in a process known as hypertrophy. Hypertrophy is initiated by a population of immature muscle cells known as myoblasts which fuse to form myotubes, and then mature to form muscle fibers (differentiation). Many proteins involved in a cascade of activation and-or deactivation are important for regulating hypertrophy (hypertrophic signaling). Failure of skeletal muscle to induce hypertrophy can lead to muscle degeneration. The FHL proteins are highly expressed in skeletal muscle. FHL proteins are molecular scaffolds which direct assembly of protein complexes to form the muscle contraction machinery (sarcomere). We propose FHL proteins will initiate-regulate skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Increased levels of FHL1 correlate with skeletal muscle hypertrophy. However, it is unclear if increased FHL1 is alone sufficient to induce hypertrophy directly. We have genetically engineered mice to express elevated levels of FHL1 specifically in skeletal muscles (FHL1 transgenic mice) and these mice show muscle enlargement. FHL1 transgenic mice have larger muscle fibers and are >7-fold stronger than non-transgenic littermates. We are currently examining which cell signaling pathways are affected by elevated FHL1. We are also investigating the role of another family member FHL3 in the differentiation of immature myoblasts, a process essential for both embryonic and postnatal skeletal muscle (hypertrophy) development. In the cell nucleus, FHL2 regulates genes which control cell growth and death and increased nuclear levels of FHL2 been detected in prostate cancer biopsies. Recently we demonstrated that FHL2 binds and is sequestered from the nucleus, by a protein, filamin. We are investigating the FHL2-mediated regulation of genes in human melanoma cells, which due to gene mutation are devoid of filamin and will determine how this affects FHL2 function in muscle.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Coeliac disease (CD) is due to an allergy to a protein (gluten) found in wheat, barley and rye. It classically causes disease of the small bowel, resulting in impaired absorption of important nutrients, and is treated by a restrictive diet eliminating foods containing extracts of these grains. However, it has recently been found that CD is much commoner than previously thought (about 1 in 100-200), and often causes only non-specific symptoms. Two important conditions linked to CD by some, but not all, researchers are ataxia (incoordination) and impairment of thinking and memory. The problem is that many normal people (12% of the population) have antibodies to gluten, so that studies suggesting that sensitivity to gluten, as determined by the presence of antibodies, causes these brain disorders are not conclusive. That is, this could be a chance association. Furthermore, there is some evidence that damage to the coordination part of the brain (the cerebellum) from other causes may also cause antibodies to gluten. It is quite possible that antibodies to the cerebellum can cross-react with gluten, and vice versa. In this case, treating patients with ataxia and antibodies to gluten with the restrictive diet may be treating the result rather than the cause of the disorder. This project will study patients with CD (proven on small bowel biopsy) with sensitive, objective methods, including MRI, electronic measures of coordination, and psychological tests of thinking and memory, to see whether CD really is associated with these two problems. It will also study coordination and brain structure in a mouse model of CD. If the associations are proven, all patients with these disorders will need to be tested for CD, and treated with the restrictive diet if found to be positive. If not, clinicians will be confident that testing for anti-gluten antibodies would be irrelevant and misleading in these two situations.',\n",

       "    'description': 'The body makes a number of responses when it is subjected to stress, and these include the secretion of hormones from the adrenal gland, including cortisol. It is not surprising that cortisol has effects upon the way the brain operates, nor is it surprising that diseases that are associated with stress (e.g. depression, alcoholism and other psychiatric complaints) create abnormal cortisol secretion. The drugs that are known to be successful in treating conditions such as depression and anxiety have been shown to affect the secretion of cortisol, but, somewhat paradoxically, we do not precisely know how they operate. The aim of this research is to examine how drugs that are commonly used for the treatment of a number of psychiatric conditions (e.g. Prozac, Tofranil, Xanax, morphine and naltrexone) affect the secretion of hormones from the brain that ulitmately regulate the secretion of cortisol. We propose that the effects of these drugs is related to how they operate, and for how long they have been given. The findings generated by this research may help us determine new ways of diagnosing and treating a range of conditions.',\n",

       "    'description': \"The inability to form new memories is a major and increasingly prevalent health problem for an aging population. In addition to aging, the inability to form new memories is associated with serious medical conditions including Alzheimer's Disease and diabetes. Common to these conditions is the inability to consolidate memories. Memories are intact for a short while (30 minutes) after the event to be remembered, but memory does not pass on into permanent storage. We have been able to achieve memory consolidation in a particular learning task, which is not normally remembered, by injection of drugs acting on novel receptors (beta 3 adrenoceptors) in the brain of day old chicks. These drugs mimic the action of noradrenaline at beta-3 adrenoceptors. There are a number of ways in which memory consolidation can be enhanced, and we will compare the effects of beta-3 drugs with other potential drugs acting at other types of noradrenaline receptors. One of the actions of beta-3 agonists is related to the uptake of glucose into cells in the brain. We will investigate whether the mechanism of beta-3 enhancement of memory involves the uptake of glucose in brain tissue and studies in cultures of individual cell types will show us which cells are involved. Although this work is done using young chicks, there is no reason to suppose that the basic memory mechanisms at the level of the nerve cell should be different in birds or mammals. There are distinct advantages to using chicks in this research as they can form a long lasting memory for an experience lasting only 10 seconds, and they will discriminate between different colours as part of their learning. This research is aimed at understanding the processes involved in and influencing memory formation. If we are going to develop drugs to alleviate the cognitive problems of old age and more serious cognitive diseases, we need to understand more about the basic mechanisms of memory formation in the normal animal.\",\n",

       "    'description': 'Platelets are extremely important cells that control bleeding by sticking to injured blood vessels to form a blood clot. Excessive clotting can lead to fatal vascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. On the other hand, defects in blood clotting can result in life threatening bleeding problems. Platelets stick to the wall of a blood vessel when receptors on the surface of these cells interact with materials (ligands) that are exposed when the vessel wall is injured. The stickiness or adhesive behaviour of platelets is controlled by many proteins (enzymes) which are contained inside these cells. These enzymes transmit messages from platelet receptors on the surface into the cell interior, thereby controlling platelet behaviour. We are in the process of identifying several types of enzymes which are responsible for controlling platelet stickiness. Our research will provide a better understanding of the complicated pathways regulating platelet stickiness and clot formation. The knowledge gained from these studies may ultimately asssist in the design of specific drugs for the prevention and-or treatment of heart attacks and strokes.',\n",

       "    'description': \"Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a major public health problem in Australia, being a key risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke. More ominously, recent WHO reports show that cardiovascular disease is the major health burden facing developing countries, particularly in our region. Although some of the burden of cardiovascular diseases may be reduced by effective public health measures (e.g., to reduce saturated fat intake), hypertension remains largely impervious to preventative public health measures. While treatment of established high blood pressure can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease, preventing the development of hypertension in the first place is not possible at this time. A major impediment to the development of effective public health measure is our lack of knowledge of the pathological mechanisms involved, despite over 100 years of active research effort. The experiments planned in this study will probe below the surface of two important facts known about hypertension but not previously brought together - that the kidney's blood vessels and nerves are remodeled in hypertension, and that the kidney's control of the level of blood pressure must be changed in order for high blood pressure to develop in the first place. We hope that pursuit of this experimental line of enquiry will provide new clues on where to look for initiating factors in human hypertension.\",\n",

The present proposal seeks to further understanding of the role of the dengue RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5, which is essential for viral RNA replication, within the viral infectious cycle. We intend to examine the subcellular targeting properties of a short central region (the interdomain) of NS5, which appears to play multiple roles in targeting to both the perinuclear Golgi-membranes and to the nucleus, as well as in inducing intracellular membranes derived from the Golgi which are the site of viral replication. We will determine how NS5 localisation-membrane induction may differ in insect and primate cells, and attempt to isolate binding partners of NS5 from the nucleus and Golgi compartment of insect and primate cells using various different approaches. Our studies should assist in understanding NS5's critical role in the Dengue infectious cycle, and contribute towards devising new anti-viral strategies such as vaccination and-or therapies targeted at the NS5 interdomain.\",\n",

This mutation occurs at a frequency of 2% in the normal population but occurs at an increased frequency (6%) in patients with thrombosis and is associated with an increase in the levels of prothombin in the blood. The position of this mutation in the prothrombin gene corresponds to the last residue of the prothrombin mRNA. We have preliminary data to suggest that this mutation results in the prothrombin mRNA being more stable, which in turn allows for the production of more prothrombin protein, leading to an increased risk of developing a blood clot. The aim of this project is to explore the mechanisms leading to the elevated levels of prothrombin observed patients with this mutation.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Very high levels of air pollution kill people. Although air quality is quite good in most Australian cities, the levels of particles are still too high. There are many sources of particles in the air including diesel vehicles and wood fires. There is a National Environment Protection Measure for particles less than 10 thousandths of a millimetre in diameter. However some recent overseas studies have suggested that tiny particles less than 0.1 thousandths of a millimetre might have the greatest effects on the heart and lungs. We will conduct the first Australian study of the health effects of these tiny particles. Particle counts will be measured in Melbourne by CSIRO using state of the art equipment. Two groups of older subjects will be recruited: patients with chronic lung diseases such as emphysema and patients with heart disease. They will perform regular breathing tests and-or have the electrical activity of their hearts recorded. The recordings will be analysed to detect small variations in heart rate. If we find relationships between particle counts and lung function or heart rate variability, this will provide new evidence of the health effects of air pollution. When the NEPMs are revised, new measures may be required for tiny particles. Particle counts can then be reduced by measures such as better controlling diesel exhaust and more efficient wood stoves.',\n",

       "    'description': 'In the lung, gas exchange takes place in small terminal airsacs called alveoli. The internal surface of the alveoli are lined with 2 types of specialist cells, the type-I and type-II cells. Both cells are essential for the normal functioning of the lung; type-I cells provide a thin barrier for the gas exchange, whereas type-II cells produce the surface-active material, surfactant. In order to survive after birth, the lungs of the newborn must have appropriate numbers of each of these cell types. However, babies that are born very prematurely have few, if any, mature cells as most are non-specialised cells that possess none of the characteristics of mature type-I and type-II cells. Therefore, the lungs of very preterm babies have low levels of surfactant, are prone to injury and infection and are not efficient in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. As such, these infants are at high risk of developing chronic lung disease which is a serious debilitating disease that has long term health implications. We believe that the non-specialised cells are more prone to injury and cell death than mature cells which makes the very premature infant more susceptible to the development of chronic lung disease. As the survival and respiratory health of these infants depends upon most type-I and type-II cells maturing after birth, it is critical to understand the factors that regulate their maturation. This information will allow the development of treatments that can enhance the maturation of these cell types. This application is focused towards understanding the factors that control maturation of type-I and type-II cells, as well as the role of the non-specialised cells in the development of chronic lung disease in babies that are born very prematurely.',\n",

       "    'description': 'The promotion of physical activity, either through organised sport or active recreation, is a key public health strategy in this country. However, there is a risk of injury during this participation and efforts need to be undertaken to reduce this risk so that spor is safe for all. Sports injury prevention efforts to date in Australia have been severely hampered by a lack of evidence supporting currently advocated countermeasures. This concern has been recognised by both the NHMRC and the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing. It is imperative that we formally evaluate the effectiveness of sports injury countermeasures in the context of broad community level participation in sport, in contrast to previous research focussed on professional sport, and begin to deliver the preventive measures to the community. Australian football is a popular sport throughout Australia and it is associated with more medically-treated injuries than any other sport. Knee injuries are particularly common and can have severe consequences. One of the most commonly recommended knee injury prevention strategies is a well-designed exercise training program. Despite their potential to significantly reduce injury rates, the effectiveness of exercise training programs to prevent knee injuries in football, and indeed in most other sports, has not previously been assessed but has been identified as a priority research area by the NHMRC. This project will determine the effectiveness of exercise training programs for preventing knee injuries in community-level football players by monitoring injury rates, player behaviours and player attitudes before and after the training programs are implemented.',\n",

       "    'description': \"Parkinson's Disease is a disabling condition that results from loss of nerve cells (neurones) in the part of the brain known as the substantia nigra (SN). These neurones make dopamine. Symptoms become apparent when 80% of these neurones are gone, suggesting that compensation can occur in the brain. Dopamine can be replaced with the drug L-dopa. Unfortunately this benefit is not sustained and is frequently marred by the production of unpleasant writhing wriggling movements called dyskinesia. These movements can also complicate the treatment for schizophrenia and other neurological conditions. The way the brain compensates for loss of SN neurones and why dyskinesia occur is unknown. However we present a hypothesis that the mechanisms for compensation also produce the dyskinesia. We have shown that an injury to the SN results in a compensatory response of vigorous sprouting of the surviving dopamine neurones. This sprouting may also explain why dyskinesias occur. The aim of this study is to establish whether the degree of compensatory response corresponds with the severity of dyskinesia and how this compensatory response can be modified or regulated.\",\n",

These brain cells contain a chemical called Dopamine (DA). The symptoms of Parkinson's disease arise when about 80% these DA neurones are lost suggesting that some form of compensation must occur up to this point. In previous studies we have demonstrated that one mechanism for this compensation is through sprouting or branching of the remaining neurones. We have preliminary evidence about the way this is sprouting and regeneration is controlled. The aim of this grant is to explore in detail the mechanisms whereby sprouting is induced and regulated. The significance of this study is that it may provide insights into the way in which regulation of regeneration of the nervous system is controlled. It has specific applications to therapies for Parkinson's disease.\",\n",

       "    'description': 'Heart disease is the leading cause of death and ill-health in Australia. Accordingly, it also imposes a significant cost burden to the community. The key to effective prevention is understanding of the roles of risk factors in the development of heart disease. These are best defined through the use of large cohort studies, which are those that follow up a group of individuals over time. Statistical analyses are used to develop prediction equations to quantify the effects of multiple risk factors in terms of their contributions to risk of heart disease. The current heart disease prediction equations most commonly used in Australia are based on older overseas studies, such as the Framingham Heart Study. Other than having low relevance to the current Australian population, they incorporate only a limited range of traditional risk factors. A spectrum of new risk factors is emerging. This study aims to develop risk prediction equations for heart disease that are applicable to the current Australian population, using contemporary data from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study. Results from this study will allow the future onset of heart disease to be predicted with accuracy and confidence, which in turn will allow preventive strategies, including expensive drugs, to be utilised in a more effective manner. Ultimately, the results will lead to a more efficient allocation of limited healthcare resources in Australia.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Excessive sleepiness is the greatest identifiable and preventable cause of accidents in all modes of transportation. Shift workers working outside the 8am-5pm day, make up about 20% of the urban working population. These individuals often report excessive daytime sleepiness caused by irregular sleep-wake patterns and long-term sleep loss. Excessive sleepiness is also common in individuals with sleep disorders. While there are many stimulant and wake-promoting drugs available to counteract daytime fatigue such drugs have problems of side effects, interactions and in some cases dependence. Light has many beneficial effects for a wide range of medicinal, physiological, psychological, and social purposes. One well known effect is as a stimulant so that exposure to bright light, both during the night and in the middle of the day, improves alertness and attention, and decreases reaction times thus improving performance. These effects can also be measured as changes in brain activity. However we do not understand the mechanisms in the eyes which control these effects. While certain cells in the eyes called rods and cones are necessary for seeing objects clearly and for detecting colour, there appears to be another system in the eyes which may involve different specialized cells or photoreceptors that are important for the alerting effects of light. White light is made up of different wavelengths or colours of light. This study will examine which wavelength (blue, violet, red or green) of light best improves alertness and learning during the daytime. Various performance tests will be used in addition to measures of brain wave activity. By identifying the most effective wavelength of light for improving alertness in healthy young adults and better understanding the mechanisms in the eyes involved, we will be able to develop light treatment strategies in patient groups with sleep disorders and in individuals like shift workers who experience sleep loss.',\n",

This will set up future studies targeting â\\x80\\x98gene readersâ\\x80\\x99 using IMiDs in combination with other targeted drugs in clinical trials.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Cells respond to the external environment, hormones, and growth factors by generating messages inside the cell that send a signal to the nucleus that stimulates cell growth. One such signalling network is that produced by membrane lipids known as phosphoinositides. Enzymes that produce these signals are known as kinases. There has been considerable interest in the PI 3-kinase as the signals generated by this enzyme are increased in many human cancers. Inherited cancer syndromes have been described that have lost the ability to switch off PI 3-kinase signals. The current project aims to investigate a recently identified enzyme called the 4-phosphatase that has the ability to terminate PI 3-kinase signals. Recent studies have shown this enzyme regulates cell growth. In addition key experiments have shown the enzyme is important as it may regulate certain strains of bacterial infection. This research proposal aims to investigate how the enzyme works to regulate these growth promoting signals. This may help us develop novel therapeutic strategies to control cell growth.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Overweight and physical inactivity are two of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. With increasing population levels of overweight, governments are increasingly advocating public health measures aimed at increasing physical activity levels or otherwise decreasing weight. There has been much research concerning which of these factors is the key prognostic factor for adverse health outcomes, but an ongoing lack of clarity of research findings has led to uncertainty as to the direction of recommendations for preventive health strategies and population lifestyle changes. In addition, the risks of overweight, in particular, have been accused of being exaggerated in both the scientific and lay literature. This is often due to the difficulty of dealing appropriately with time varying confounders which are also intermediate factors (such as hypertension). To date, no studies have performed careful longitudinal modelling of the joint effects of physical inactivity and overweight on cardiovascular events and diabetes while taking into account the effects of factors, such as hypertension or atherosclerosis, that influence both physical activity and overweight as well as disease, and simultaneously are consequences of these risk factors. Standard statistical methods are known to produce biased estimates in these situations but we will apply more recently developed statistical techniques to provide much improved estimation of these effects. After the statistical modelling stage, we will model the burden of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and mortality associated with given levels of overweight and physical inactivity. These will be combined with population levels of overweight and inactivity to identify the fraction of the current and future burden of disease attributable to these risk factors.',\n",

       "    'description': 'In the areas of the brain where visual information is processed, cells respond to the presentation of visual stimuli by changing their pattern of electrical activity. At the first level of analysis, the primary visual cortex (V1), individual cells become active only if line segments or borders of a particular orientation are present in their field of detection, which encompasses a small part of the visual scene. Cells in other visual cortical areas (the extrastriate cortex) perform more complex detection tasks in comparison with those in V1, which demand integration of information coming from much larger portions of the visual scene. One example of these more complex properties is the phenomenon of long-range contour integration, where our visual system groups individual line segments having similar orientations, so that they are perceived as part of the same contour. This property is reflected in the electrical responses of cells in the dorsomedial visual area (DM). How are properties such as orientation specificity and long-range contour integration created? To begin addressing this question, we will investigate correlations between the physiological properties of identified cells, the spatial distribution of their information collecting regions (dendrites), and the anatomical pathways by which they receive information from other parts of the brain. This is a basic science study aimed at determining the extent to which the anatomical structure of the brain helps define the function of individual cells and brain areas. Its primary benefit will be to increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying all sensory processing in the brain. The knowledge obtained may also lead to developments in areas of applied research including medicine and cognitive science (for example, understanding how the brain learns to interpret visual information in early life, and how visual processing degrades with ageing).',\n",

       "    'description': 'This study addresses occupational injury among male adult farm workers. The health and safety performance of agricultural industries is among the worst in Australia. A recently published study of work-related fatalities from 1989 to 1992 found that rural industries ranked third, with a fatality rate 3-4 times that for all industries. The rural industries accounted for 80 deaths annually. Best estimates place the cost of farm injury between $0.5 and $1.29 billion per year. This study is designed to contribute to farm injury prevention by: (1) identifying factors associated with a higher risk of serious injury among adult farm workers and (2) determining the proportions of the farm workforce who are exposed to various injury risks. The study will recruit 300 seriously injured or killed farm workers from regional Victoria and collect information about themselves, their working life and the property on which they work. This information will be compared with 600 randomly selected farm workers who are not seriously injured to determine which personal, work and environmental factors place farm workers at higher risk of injury. The study will lead to the development of new or more refined prevention strategies and programs. A study of this kind has not been conducted before in Australia and would contribute to a continuing scientific basis for selection of interventions for farm injury and targeting of prevention programs, at a time of increasing momentum in agricultural health and safety.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease affecting approximately 1% of the population. It is characterised by severe inflammation and destruction of joints resulting in significant health problems. The lining tissue of joints is known to be infiltrated by inflammatory cells. In addition to this infiltration of inflammatory cells, there is overgrowth of the normal lining cells of joints. These overgrowing cells contribute significantly to joint damage by invading cartilage and bone and allowing inflammatory cells to reach these areas. The abnormal growth of these cells has been related to the malfunction of certain genes that usually restrain abnormal growth. These genes called tumour suppressor genes are known to be damaged in joint lining cells derived from RA. The best known of these abnormal tumour suppressor genes is called p 53. The product of the p53 gene, the p 53 protein, is particularly important in slowing down the growth of cells. The applicant has recently shown that an inflammatory product called MIF is released in large quantities by joint lining cells in RA. Previous studies by the applicant have shown that blocking MIF using an antibody almost completely prevents arthritis development in a rat model. These studies indicate that MIF is likely to be an important contributor to disease in RA. Recent preliminary studies in the applicant s laboratory have shown that MIF can decrease p53 levels in joint lining cells from RA patients and also that MIF can increase the growth rate of these cells. These preliminary data indicate that MIF may contribute significantly to disease in RA by overriding control of normal cell growth by p53. Confirmation and full exploration of the regulation of p53 expression and function by MIF may highlight a novel way to treat the excessive growth and invasion by joint lining cells which characterises RA.',\n",

       "    'description': \"Mental Health is one of the national health priority areas as well as one of the largest contributors to burden of disease. WHO projections suggest that by 2020 the burden of depression alone will be second only to cardiovascular disease. New treatments for mental disorders are being developed which must be evaluated. Current research methods do not allow an accurate comparison of the cost effectiveness of these therapies with the cost effectiveness of other medical services as this requires the measurement of 'utility' or 'quality of life'. The small number of 'generic' 'quality of life instruments' developed to date vary significantly in their 'sensitivity' to different illnesses-their ability to detect change-and none is very sensitive to changes in mental health states. The present project is to overcome this deficit. This will be achieved by refining and expanding an instrument developed in Australia, the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL) instrument. This is the only instrument to date which was both constructed using correct psychometric principles of instrument construction and which describes health states in terms of the effect upon a patient's ability to function in a social environment. The new instrument called the PsyQoL will increase instrument sensitivity by including a mental health 'module' to the existing instrument and revising existing items. The methods used will include several methodological innovations in the description of health states and the derivation of utility scores. The project will include a large scale 'validation' study which will include the construction of population 'norms' and also the creation of 'exchange rates' between the PsyQoL and other instrument scores. The significance of the project is that the PsyQoL will allow valid and reliable measurement of health states in a way that creates a 'level playing field' between mental and other health related interventions.\",\n",

       "    'description': 'Bacterial species belonging to the genus Shigella are responsible for intestinal diseases ranging from mild diarrhoea to life threatening bacillary dysentery. Such diseases kill over a million people, mainly infants in developing countries, every year and lead to serious morbidity and mortality even in industrialised countries with well developed health care systems. In many cases the virulence of Shigella species is augmented by large fragments of DNA, called pathogenicity islands, that carry genes which contribute to the development of disease (pathogenesis) in humans. Pathogenicity islands are important genetic elements which appear to spread independantly throughout bacterial populations and therefore contribute to the emergence of new virulence traits in bacteria. Recently, we identified two related pathogenicity islands carried by both Shigella flexneri and other species of the genus Shigella. The two pathogenicity islands belong to a unique class of genetic elements found in Shigella species and virulent strains of the intestinal bacterium E. coli. Our current study is aimed at (1) understanding the mechanisms by which one of these islands, the she pathogenicity island, spreads from one bacterial strain to another to introduce disease-producing or virulence genes to new bacteria and (2) to study how the sigA virulence gene, carried on the she pathogenicity island, contributes to disease development in humans. We know that sigA encodes a protein toxin which contributes to the loss of fluid from the intestines of rabbits that have been experimentally infected with Shigella flexneri. We propose to study the structure and function of the SigA protein to determine how it interacts with tissues to produce a pathological state. Such studies will enhance our understanding of the process of disease development and contribute to the investigation and assessment of new strategies for therapeutic intervention.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Platelets are small blood cells that play an essential role in the normal blood clotting process that stops bleeding following an injury to a blood vessel. In addition to their important role in preventing bleeding, they are also responsible for the development of harmful blood clots which can sometimes result in a fatal outcome in the form of a heart attack or a stroke. When platelets stick to sites of blood vessel injury they must respond very rapidly to ensure the formation of a stable blood clot. Our research studies are aimed at understanding more closely the factors that regulate the adhesiveness of platelets, since this is an important deteminant not only in normal blood clot formation but also in the development of harmful blood clots (thrombosis). A better understanding of these processes will add significantly to our knowledge of how blood clotting is controlled. This information is relevant to many human diseases including heart attack and stroke.',\n",

       "    'description': 'We are able to identify and discriminate objects in the world because of exquisitely detailed and rapid processing of sensory information by neurons in the cortex of the brain. In this project we will examine these operations in neurons in the cortex that receive input from the large face whiskers of the rat. These whiskers are used for fine-grain discrimination and for gauging distance. They are deflected by being actively moved, under muscle control, over objects (active touch) or by being passively deflected by objects. Deflection results in inputs to the brain that are processed to form the neural basis for very finely detailed perceptual behaviour. In rats, with impoverished visual and auditory senses, the whiskers are the major sensory system for interacting with the world, and are used in navigating the environment and in finding and distinguishing foods. Thus they contribute strongly to the remarkable success of this species. This elegant sensory system has a number of advantages that make it a very good model for the study of brain mechanisms responsible for active fine-grain sensory function. We plan to take advantage of the unique features of this system to define the information processing that occurs in the cortex in this elegantly complex system. This will address an issue relevant to all sensory systems - namely the neural basis of complex fine grain perceptual behaviour. Understanding the mechanisms underlying active tactile perception also has relevance to clinical conditions involving deficits in active touch e.g., in diabetic polyneuropathy (which eventually affects ~50% of diabetics), in leprosy (in which an early sign is damage to active touch). Knowledge of the core brain processes in active touch gained in this study could eventually underpin the ameliorative technologies for such deficits.',\n",

       "    'description': \"Survival at birth depends on the baby being able to breathe effectively, to maintain adequate blood flow to every organ, and for the brain to coordinate these activities. Failure of any one of these will result in death. In this application we propose that the ability of the fetus and newborn baby to obtain adequate supplies of CREATINE is essential for survival, because this substance is essential for maintaining energy turnover in all cells in the body. In the adult, CREATINE is obtained either from the diet (after absorption from the gut), or after synthesis in, and release from the liver. We do not know how fetal tissues obtain CREATINE, but we do know that when CREATINE is too low the fetus is likely to die, and that if extra CREATINE is supplied in the mother's diet the fetus is more likely to survive profound asphyxia at birth. In this project, in pregnant animals we will determine if fetal tissues can synthesize and take up CREATINE, and if providing extra CREATINE in the maternal diet throughout pregnancy can protect the heart, brain and breathing apparatus from the damaging effects of asphyxia or low oxygen (hypoxia). If successful, we will have developed a new treatment for pregnant women that protects their unborn baby from the dangers of birth asphyxia.\",\n",

       "    'description': 'Male infertility affects 1 in 20 Australian men and for the majority of other men, contraception is an issue at some point in their lives. Despite this, relatively little is known about the processes of sperm production and fertilization. As such, there is an urgent need for futher research if we are to hope to develop diagnostics, targeted therapeutics and to take advantage of the growing awareness by pharmaceutical companies of the market for male gamete based contraceptives. The cysteine rich secretory proteins (Crisps) are a group of proteins which show a remarkable bias to the male reproductive tract. All four are incorporated into sperm. Recently published data from us indicates that they have the ability to regulated calcium flow in sperm and as such sperm activity. The aim of the current proposal is to explore the biological relevance of one domain of Crisp proteins using animal models, in vitro sperm tests and through an analysis of ion flux and phosphorylation status under conditions of altered Crisp-1 and -2 content. The data generated from this project will make a significant contribution to the development of novel male gamete based contraceptives for use by either men or women. In addition, through the attainment of a greater understanding of sperm development and function, we will be able to more precisely define types of infertility, thus allowing for the development of more targeted therapies. The development of Crisp agonists or antagonists may also be of value in the treatment of other cilia disorders including primary cilia dykinesia and cystic fibrosis.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Obesity is a major and increasing health concern for almost half the adult population, and is associated with serious medical conditions including diabetes and heart disease. Changes in behaviour such as increasing physical activity and eating less high-calorie food help many people reduce their body weight, however many others have a genetic predisposition to become overweight and behavioural measures are ineffective. Although anti-obesity drugs should be a valuable adjunct to lifestyle changes, the currently available appetite suppressants are not ideal. Our work involves studying particular cell-surface proteins (receptors) which normally respond to hormones such as adrenaline. The beta(3)-adrenergic receptor is known to mediate the breakdown of fats and increased heat production in adipose tissue and possibly muscle. Administration of beta(3)-selective drugs to obese mice promotes weight loss and a reduction of diabetic symptoms, and a number of drugs targetting the human beta(3)-adrenergic receptor are being developed by pharmaceutical companies. We are trying to understand more about the properties of this receptor, as this information will assist in designing drugs which are more selective and more potent. Sometimes drugs act at more than one receptor, and there is evidence that this may be the case for two drugs called CGP 12177 and BRL 37344 which stimulate the beta(3)-adrenergic receptor. The second major aim of our project is to find out whether these drugs act at a novel receptor which is related to the beta(3)-adrenergic receptor and also mediates energy expenditure and heat production in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. The discovery of a new receptor would provide additional scope for the development of effective anti-obesity treatments.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Thrombosis is a significant disease affecting a large number of people. The primary treatment for episodes of acute thrombosis is administration of the anticoagulant, heparin. The effector molecule through which heparin carries out its action is the serine proteinase inhibitor, antithrombin. This molecule regulates blood clotting by inhibiting the proteinases which carry out this process. Antithrombin is converted from a poor inhibitor of coagulation proteases to a very good inhibitor on binding heparin. This provides a control point for coagulation. The mechanism by which antithrombin is converted to a very good inhibitor of coagulation proteases involves a large change in the structure of this protein. These changes in structure are linked to the changes which occur when antithrombin becomes inactive through the process of polymerisation. Certain patients with thrombosis have been found to have changes in both the stability and heparin affinity of their antithrombin molecules, which forms the underlying basis for the disease. We wish to study the reasons for the effects of mutations in the antithrombin variants by making recombinant mutants which mimic the molecules in the thrombotic patients and carrying out detailed, sophisticated molecular analyses of their interaction with heparin and proteases and their stability under various conditions. Additionally we will engineer recombinant mutants of antithrombin which we believe will stabilise the molecule and potentially act as an improved supplement for therapy. This analysis will provide important insights into the functioning of both heparin and antithrombin and thereby significantly improve our understanding of the control of coagulation.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Osteoarthritis (OA) has the largest impact of any chronic disease on burden of disease borne in later life, affecting women more often than men. The importance of OA has been acknowledged by its listing within musculoskeletal disease, the 7th health priority in Australia. It is 4 times as common in women as in men.Treatments which slow or prevent OA progressing are limited, so prevention must play a key role. With increasing disease severity, joint cartilage is lost. We have recently developed a method to measure joint cartilage from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans which is able to assess the severity of structural changes in the knee. Using this method will allow us to assess 2 issues: 1) Obesity is the only identified modifiable risk factor for knee OA. However, the mechanism is poorly understood. Weight loss programs may be more effective at reducing the risk of OA if they are combined with programs aimed at maintaining muscle mass. 2) Bone is important in development of Knee OA, but its role is poorly understood. Understanding how bone metabolism relates to risk of knee OA may allow us to prevent disease. Bone is more likely to respond to pharmacological manipulation than cartilage. Thus it may prove a more effective target for intervention than cartilage. The Geelong Osteoporosis Study was begun in 1994 to study bone health in Australian women (urban and rural). Much information relevant to the risk of OA has been collected over the past decade. By performing MRI of the knee now and in 2 years time, we will determine the effect of different measures of obesity and bone metabolism on structural change at the knee which predisposes to OA. Since both of these factors (obesity and bone metabolism) are potentially modifiable, this study may offer new avenues of prevention and therapy in knee OA. This has the potential to promote a better quality of life as people age and to reduce the economic burden of knee OA in the community.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is a key enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), converting Angiotensin I to the potent vasoconstrictor Angiotensin II (Ang II). ACE inhibitors have been highly successful in the management of hypertension, are standard therapy following myocardial infarction to delay the development of heart failure, and also reduce the rate of progression of renal disease. Recently, a novel enzyme called ACE2 has been discovered in the heart and kidneys. Unlike ACE, ACE2 causes the formation of the vasodilator, Ang 1-7. We have data in the heart and the kidney that supports the concept that ACE2 acts in a counter-regulatory manner to ACE. We suggest that ACE2 may play an important role to modulate the balance between vasoconstrictors and vasodilators in the heart and kidney. The studies detailed in this proposal are designed to specifically examine the role and regulation of ACE2 in the healthy heart and kidney as well as in cardiovascular and renal disease. The project brings together two groups with complementary skills and techniques, both of whom have collaborations with the discoverers of ACE2, and who have been exploring the role of ACE2 as evidenced from our recent publication (Tikellis et al, Hypertension in press, 2003).',\n",

Despite this, relatively little is known about the factors that effect disease progression. This will be the first extended follow up study of cartilage volume in people with early OA. This study will build on our existing work where we have developed a cohort study of adults with early knee OA. These people were initially recruited in 1997-8. An extensive data base of potential risk factors for OA has been collected and both X-rays of the knee and MRI have been performed at baseline and 2 years. Extending the follow up from 2 to 5 years will allow not only more precise estimation of rates of cartilage loss and assessment of risk factors, but also enable assessment of the assumption of linearity of cartilage volume loss. It will also be possible to partition the observed variability in rates of loss into true between-subject variability and within subject residual variability. This partitioning will provide valuable information for the design of future studies in OA, similar to the establishment of statistical design principles for patterns of loss in bone mineral density.',\n",

Autism is associated with personal suffering and is a significant burden and stress for parents, families and carers and cost to the community. In earlier work we have demonstrated that providing a structured program of parent education and guidance to families with preschool children with autism leads to improved parental adjustment and mental health. The program also led to behavioural and developmental benefits for the child. The early secondary school years bring further stress and difficulty to adolescents with autism and their families. This project aims to assess the effectiveness of a parent education and training program for parents with autistic adolescents aged 12-14 years. If shown to be effective, this manual based intervention can be readily used by professionals to promote parent mental health, family adjustment and improve the wellbeing and outcome for adolescents with autism. As a result, family stress and the necessity of out of home care may be reduced and school participation improved.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Brain damage is present in some babies at birth, and recent epidemiological and clinical studies strongly suggest that this either occurs some time during the pregnancy, or the conditions are such that the fetal brain is particularly vulnerable to the stresses that are present during labor and birth. In this project we propose that hypoxic (low oxygen) conditions in the womb, either alone or in combination with substances released because of maternal infection, cause accumulation of a neurotoxic substance - QUINOLINIC ACID - in the fetal brain and circulation. The increased production of QUINOLINIC ACID occurs because certain cells react to the low oxygen and infectious conditions - these cells include MICROGLIA, a cell type in the brain. Little is currently known about MICROGLIA in the developing brain. We will therefore study the effects of hypoxia and infection in fetal sheep, and we will determine how these conditions affect MICROGLIA and the synthesis of QUINOLINIC ACID in the fetal brain. The capacity of the brain to produce QUINOLINIC ACID is closely related to the dietary intake of the essential amino acid TRYPTOPHAN, and it is decreased when synthetic analogues of tryptophan are infused. Therefore, we have devised a treatment regime using these tryptophan analogues to prevent increases of QUINOLINIC ACID concnetrations in the fetal brain, and we propose that a simple treament is at hand to reduce the incidence of perinatal brain damage in human pregnancies.',\n",

We have identified a family of genes called the Fras and Frem genes and some of these are mutated in a disorder called Fraser Syndrome. Fraser Syndrome patients have profound defects in the normal development of their skin and kidneys. We are studying the function of these genes with a view to understanding not just how Fraser Syndrome develops, but how our organs develop normally. The genes involved in FS contribute to the extracellular matrix which is effectively the scaffolding which our cells use when developing into our organs. The extracellular matrix is also important in maintaining our adult tissues and responding to damage. It can act as a physical support and as a key controller of how ours cells react to growth factors and to each other. This proposal will explore how the Fras and Frem genes mediate these interactions to control normal development and also to determine how their mutation gives rise to disease. In doing so we hope to gain insights into more common diseases which affect both the kidney and the skin.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Each month when the uterine lining does not receive an implanting embryo, this lining is shed as part of the menstrual process. It is rapidly replaced with a new functional lining that grows from the basal layer that remains. In post menopausal women, who only have the thin basal layer of the uterine lining, there is rapid regeneration of the lining when they commence hormone replacement therapy. Despite this remarkable regenerative capacity of the uterine lining, nothing is known about the precursor cells responsible for its cyclical growth. Our preliminary studies have shown that the human uterine lining contains a rare population of cells with high proliferative capacity. This project will identify, characterize and locate these precursor cells in the human uterine lining. It also aims to obtain information on how these precursor cells function in regenerating the uterine lining, how they interact with sex hormones and how their proliferative activity is regulated. Information generated from this project will provide significant new insight into the functioning of the uterine lining. It also has immediate application to common gynaecological diseases associated with abnormal growth of the uterine lining, such as endometriosis, a disease which affects 10% of reproductive age women causing pain and infertility. A better understanding of how these precursor cells may be involved in endometriosis and other gynaecological diseases may ultimately lead to the development of improved medical treatments rather than surgical intervention, which is currently the main form of treatment.',\n",

       "    'description': 'GENERAL BACKGROUND : Our ability to determine where a sound is coming from (localization ability) is severely disrupted when the environment is noisy. This affects our abilities at many ordinary tasks, such as keeping up a conversation in a noisy background, and also in other critical tasks (eg., in following warning signals in a noisy factory environment). In people who have some hearing loss, even if only partial deafness, localization ability is disrupted even when there is no noise in the background, and is even more severely disrupted when the environment is noisy. SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND : Our localization ability depends on the way neurons in the brain code the position of a source of sound we wish to detect. From studies in animals we know a lot about the way in which neurons do this coding in silence. However, we know almost nothing about how this coding is affected by a noisy background. Further, we know absolutely nothing about how this coding, whether in silence or when there is noise, is affected when there is also a hearing loss. SIGNIFICANCE : If we are to understand the effects of hearing losses on coding of the location of a sound signal we need to know first how noise affects the coding in cases of normal hearing. This project aims to gain that information. I will then extend this to studying the detailed basis of these effects, ie., exactly what mechanisms are affected in the neurons. Then I will determine how noise from different positions affects the coding of signal sounds at differnt positions. These data will provide us the essential base from which we can, later, go on to study how noise affects coding by neurons of the location of a signal. I plan to increase the value of the current study by developing, from the data gained in the studies in animals, computer-based models that will allow us to predict how coding of sound signal location is affected by hearing loss, and how this is exacerbated by noisy environments.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Growth factors and insulin stimulate a complex array of signals inside the cell, which are important for both cell survival and metabolism. A central intracellular signaling enzyme that initiates lipid messages that promote glucose uptake into the cell and promote cell survival is that generated by the PI3-kinase. This enzyme has increased activity in many cancers, and is also important in diabetes when the enzyme may be suppressed. Our grant proposes to investigate the function of another enzyme called SKIP which acts within the cell to oppose the functions of the PI3-kinase. Several lines of evidence indicate SKIP may be important in both development and cancer. SKIP has been identified as a putative candidate gene for a developmental disorder known as Miller Dieker syndrome. This disease is associated with facial and significant brain abnormalities. In addition the SKIP gene is located on a chromosome that is frequently deleted in breast and colon cancer. SKIP is an enzyme that functions to remove phosphate molecules from PI3-kinase signaling molecules. SKIP has been shown to prevent glucose uptake into the cell by breaking down PI3-kinase signals. We have recently demonstrated SKIP phosphatase activity can be inhibited by binding to another protein called suppressor of death domains (SODD). We plan to investigate the effects this complex has on SKIP enzyme activity, and how this complex plays a role in regulating PI3-kinase signals that promote glucose uptake. Secondly, we plan to investigate the function of SKIP in an intact animal by making mice which lack SKIP(knock out mice). Given SKIP is implicated in a developmental syndrome and insulin signaling, we can delineate the functional significance of SKIP and the molecular pathways regulated by this enzyme.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Bacteria that cause disease produce substances called virulence determinants, often on their cell surface. These virulence determinants are either directly involved in allowing infection to take place, or cause the damage that we recognize as an infectious disease. Some virulence determinants are produced all the time, while others are only made under particular conditions, that is, their expression is regulated. To target efforts in the development of new vaccines and treatments, it is important to identify all the virulence determinants produced by a particular bacterial species, but also to know which are regulated, and the environmental signals that determine their expression. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis are two important disease-causing bacteria that exclusively infect humans and cause gonorrhoea, and meningitis. The complete DNA sequence of both of these bacteria is now known. From computer analysis of these data, it appears that these bacteria have few of the specific regulatory systems that are present in other bacteria. Because of the limited repertoire of regulatory systems still present in N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis, it is feasible to mutate each one and determine which are involved in regulation of virulence determinants. We have made copies of every individual gene found in the DNA sequence of these bacteria and have attached each one individually to a glass slide to form a microarray measuring 18mm x 18mm. This microarray will allow us to monitor the expression of every gene in these bacteria in response to environmental signals. This information will be used to identify all the virulence genes controlled by each regulatory system. Such an analysis has never been previously achieved for any bacterial species, because of the number and complexity of the regulatory systems usually present.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Pharmacological modulation of the renin angiotensin system is a cornerstone of evidence-based cardiovascular therapeutics. However, their molecular mechanisms are not entirely clear and some therapeutic options have not been utilized to their full potential. The hormone angiotensin II causes both excitatory and inhibitory cardiovascular effects via distinct binding sites. Of particular importance to contemporary society is the shift in the demographic to a more aged population. In Australia in 2002, 13% of the population (~2.5 million) were aged 65 years or over, and it has been estimated that this number will increase to 18% (~4 million) by the year 2021. While lipid status and smoking are well known risk factors for cardiovascular disease, advanced age by far confers the greatest risk for cardiovascular disease. In this context, we have found a greater role of the inhibitory angiotensin II binding site in aging that may result from breakdown products of angiotensin II having their own unique effects. This project will determine the relative role of various angiotensin products, and novel compounds that may act similarly, to improve vascular tone and reverse cardiovascular disease in the elderly, hypertensive population.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Cells respond to external signals and the environment to undergo cell growth, secretion and-or other specialized functions including control of cell death and-or cell size. We have identified a new enzyme (72kDa 5-phosphatase) which resides inside the cell and regulates signals generated by an enzyme called PI3-kinase. Two of the PI3-kinase signals have been demonstrated to regulate the activity of an oncogene involved in breast and ovarian cancer. We aim to determine the specific role each of these PI3-kinase signals plays in the activation of the oncogene. In addition the levels of the 72kDa enzyme is altered in some cervical and lymphoma cancers. We will image live cells containing specific fluorescent probes under different conditions and study the activation and location of these probes in order to understand how different PI3-kinase signals are regulated in time and space. In addition to regulating signals that are involved in cancer, PI3-kinase controls signals that are important for proper immune function. Phagocytosis is a biological process where specialised immune cells (macrophages) take up and remove harmful particles such as bacteria or tumour cells from the circulation. This process depends on PI3-kinase and the signals it produces. We will determine whether the 72 kDa enzyme, which is expressed in macrophages, plays a role in regulating these signals during phagocytosis. We have shown that the 72 kDa enzyme can interact with several different proteins which may affect its location and activity within the cell. We will examine the effect of these interactions on the PI3-kinase signals which are involved in cell survival and immune responses. We will study the function of the enzyme in the intact animal by producing mice which lack this enzyme. Given the possible role of this enzyme in cancer, these mice will be examined for their susceptibility to develop tumours.',\n",

       "    'description': \"Box jellyfish are an ongoing cause of illness and death for coastal communities and tourist regions in northern Australia. As well as creating a significant medical problem, the resulting closure of beaches during boxjellyfish 'season' results in an enormous loss of tourism income and threatens Australia's reputation as a safe destination. The jellyfish venoms contain toxins with potentially lethal effects on humans. For the first time, using pure venoms derived from the specialised stinging cells (i.e. nematocytsts), we will isolate and characterize the major toxins from four species of box jellyfish. Their mechanism of action will be determined and the effect of various treatments such as antivenom will be investigated. This will also lead to the discovery of toxins with potentially novel targets and modes of action and increase our understanding of proposed treatments and prevention of stings.\",\n",

       "    'description': \"It is a well-known observation that after a period of intense exercise we are unsteady on our feet and are clumsy when attempting to make precision movements. Such impressions are particularly marked after eccentric exercise, during which the contracting muscles are forcibly lengthened. Activities such as walking downhill, skiing and horse riding involve eccentric exercise. The debilitating consequences of this kind of exercise are attributed, not just to the post-exercise effects of fatigue, but to loss of muscle force from damage to fibres. Eccentric exercise also leads to longer term effects. The breakdown of the damaged tissue leads to sensations of stiffness and soreness the next day. This application proposes experiments aimed at studying a number of effects of eccentric exercise on motor control, and establishing the muscle, spinal and brain levels at which they occur. Three studies are planned. In the first, the question will be explored whether we are less able to use the motor areas of our brains to execute voluntary contractions after exercise. So fatigue is not just a matter of exhausted muscles but perhaps also exhausted brains. We will use brain and spinal cord stimulation to explore this point. Then we plan to listen to single motor units, the basic elements of muscle control, to try to understand the mechanism by which the brain minimises the debilitating effects of fatigue. Finally we want to examine subjects' ability to locate their limbs in space as a means of providing a basis for the clumsiness we experience after intense exercise. These are all important issues relevant to clinical medicine and rehabilitation as well as sports science and exercise.\",\n",

       "    'description': \"This study aims to investigate whether there is a link between cancer (in particular cancer of the stomach, lung, kidney and central nervous system) and occupational exposure to lead compounds. There are only a few published cohort studies available on occupational exposures in use and applications of lead compounds, despite the widespread use of these compounds in the past 50 years. Since the late 1980s the use of lead compounds in Australia has decreased, but Australian and world lead production has increased. Australia is the world's biggest producer of lead. The precise number of lead workers worldwide is unknown but there are likely to be more than 2 million workers of which many are in developing countries where control of lead exposure is unsatisfactory and occupational exposure limits are considerably higher than in developed countries. Evidence for or against cancer risk with exposure to lead compounds , in particular inorganic lead, will therefore have implications for many Australian and international workers. This is also important for health risk assessment for environmental contamination in the Australian community. In our study we will review the state government archived records of about 8,000 lead workers in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, who took part in lead compound exposure surveys and had blood tests in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, as part of government lead regulations in force at the time. We will then match the details of these workers against the National Cancer and Death registry data to calculate cancer rates. This should involve a sufficient number of workers to enable us to undertake a comprehensive health evaluation of cancer risk and exposure to lead compounds.\",\n",

CIAâ\\x80\\x99s lab has demonstrated the potential importance of MIF in the pathology of chronic inflammation via studies in models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Similarly to other chronic inflammatory diseases, MIF is overexpressed in human RA, and induces activation of key pathological processes in RA cells. Moreover, antagonism of MIF with mAb profoundly inhibits models of RA and other inflammatory diseases, confirming MIF as a therapeutic target in human inflammatory disease. The X-ray crystal structure of MIF has been published and the putative active site fully characterised. We have deduced structural features of MIF that reveal aspects of the structural complementarity of host-guest affinity. This information has been used in the synthesis of new compounds to antagonise MIF. We have designed, synthesised and tested several classes of compounds, which have shown activity from milli to nano-molar levels in novel in-house in vitro bioassays.',\n",

The most important events of the cell cycle concern the replication of chromosomal DNA during S phase and the separation of replicated DNA into progeny cells at mitosis. Mitosis is morphologically the most dynamic phase of the cell cycle and involves the precise coordination of many processes that are governed by reversible protein phosphorylation. Protein phosphatases play an important role in reversible protein phosphorylation and they are essential for mitosis. This grant proposal is focused on understanding the regulation and function of protein phosphatases in mitosis. Our studies will provide novel insight into processes mediating mitosis and may lead to the development of alternative strategies for treating cancer.',\n",

       "    'description': 'The interferons are signaling molecules produced by cells as part of an early warning sytsem to alert nearby tissue cells and immune cells to defend themselves against an impending viral attack or aberrant growth of cells. We have discovered ISG60, a new member of a group of proteins called the ISG54 family. The production of this family of proteins is turned on in all cells responding to the interferons. Exactly what the members of the protein family do within cells remains to be established. However, by preparing cells which produce the ISG60 protein, we have found that it severely affects their growth, slowing the growth rate down and making the cells divide abnormally to become large, containing many nuclei and others dying. We propose that ISG60 binds to the structures involved in cell division and we have preliminary evidence that ISG60 interacts with an important protein involved in cell regulation, the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). The aim of this project is to more fully understand the role of ISG60 in cells. In particular, we aim to determine if ISG60 interacts with other important proteins inside cells. We shall explore the relationship of ISG60 function inside cells in greater detail as it should provide new insight into ways in which cell growth is regulated. This study will also provide insight into how the slowing of cell growth makes the cells less suitable for viral infection and reproduction, as well as providing new approaches for preventing the growth of cancer cells.',\n",

The mouse model is unique as the mice suffer from the same type of movement abnormalities which afflict individuals with this spectrum of neurological illnesses. We will look at both structural changes in the brain as well as brain function as defined by the behavioural responses of the damaged brain to drug administration. The experiments also focus on the ultimate correction of the neurological deficits by transplantation of purified nerve cell progenitor cells.\",\n",

Disorders of thirst whether they be excessive or inadequate have dire conseqences as evidenced in recent heat waves in Europe and Indiawhere thousands of lives were lost primarily in the elderly whose thirst mechanisms are often disrupted. The excessive fluid intake, seen in psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, is equally damaging. Much of the research over the last 50 years has concentrated on the hypothalamic regulation of thirst. This project will attempt, for the first time, to define the location in the cerebral cortex of the drive to ingest water (perception of thirst).',\n",

       "    'description': 'Our innate immune system evolved as the front line defence against infection. However an uncontrolled response can lead to serious diseases such as septic shock, chronic inflammation as in hepatitis, autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. The immune respnse is regulated by important hormones such as interferon produced by the body in these situations. This project aims to understand the negative or inhibitory mechanisms that prevent dangerous side effects of interferons without restricting their postive or beneficial effects. We will examine the actions of a molecule called the Suppressor of cytokin Signaling 1 (socs1) which we have recently discovered to modulate the actions of interferon in the mouse. Initially our studies will determine which molecules SOCS1 binds to inside a cell and the consequences for cell activation pathways. The next step will be to specifically block this interaction in the mouse and determine the effects on models of viral infection and inflammatory disease. The outcome of these studies will be a better understanding of how the body fights disease via the immune response and potential new approaches to develop therapeutic drugs.',\n",

The role of this hormone is cause blood vessels to constrict (vasoconstriction), thus causing a rise in blood pressure.

The aim of this grant is to understqand the mechanisdms by which the location of this enzyme within the cell is regulated.

       "    'description': \"Brain damage in the newborn - particularly in prematurely born infants - remains a significant health problem. At present there are very few treatments that can be used to minimize damage when it becomes apparent in the newborn, and none that can be used PROSPECTIVELYduring pregnancy to protect the developing brain from damage. The most likely cause of damage to the fetal brain during pregnancy or at birth is global ASPHYXIA, either by itself or in association with other problems of pregnancy such as infection, preterm birth, or fetal growth retardation. In this project we propose that providing extra amounts of the dietary constituent creatine, or of the hormone melatonin, to the pregnant animal in late gestation, will provide NEUROPROTECTION to the developing brain in the face of an asphyxial challenge that otherwise causes damage. We will use pregnant sheep to investigate the effects of asphyxia in utero on the fetal brain using techniques that allow us to monitor metabolic changes within the brain in real time. In addition, we will use the pregnant Spiny Mouse to investigate the effects of birth asphyxia on the postnatal brain structure and behavioral development. We will study groups of animals fed a normal diet, and compare then to animals that receive additional amounts of creatine or melatonin. We expect to determine if either of these treatments have the potential to protect the developing brain from asphyxial damage, and to recommend if similar treatments could be used in pregnant women where the obstetrician suspects the baby's brain is at risk of damage.\",\n",

More recently, t-PA has been shown to influence memory development and under pathological conditions can promote neuronal cell death. t-PA is produced by many cells including the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels, fibroblasts, as well as cells within the central nervous system. The t-PA gene is regulated very differently in these cell types and this project will address the mechanisms underlying the cell-type specific regulation of the t-PA gene. Endothelial cells, fibroblasts and neuronal cell cultures will be used to study the regulation of t-PA expression. Information gained will not only add to the understanding of the broader field of gene regulation, but may also provide clues to manipulate the expression of the t-PA gene in different cells.',\n",

       "    'description': \"The aim of this project is to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of gas gangrene, an often fatal disease of particular significance to elderly and diabetic patients, who are particularly susceptible following injury, or surgery, or in some cases when suffering from colon cancer. Although research has been carried out on this disease for many years prompt surgical removal of the infected tissue, often including amputation of a limb, is still commonly used to ensure the patient's survival. This project involves the study of the two bacteria that are the major causes of the disease. We aim to find out how the bacteria mediate the disease, in particular to determine which toxic factors produced by the bacteria are involved. The normal host response to a bacterial infection is a rapid influx of white blood cells to the infected tissue, which is part of the normal inflammatory response. These cells engulf and degrade the bacteria, clearing the infection. However, a major characteristic of gas gangrene pathology is that very few white blood cells infiltrate the infected tissue. We aim to determine why the host fails to mount an inflammatory response to this bacterial infection. We will achieve this objective by developing a better understanding of the role of the bacterial toxins in the development of this morbid disease. It is hoped the results from this study will enable the development of more effective therapeutic and prophylactic treatments for this disease and also provide a foundation for studies into the modulation of the host response by other bacterial species.\",\n",

       "    'description': 'Autism is a severely handicapping disorder adversely affecting social interaction, communication, and behaviour, interests and activities. Over the past 9 years our team has conducted a follow-up study of a large group of 111 Australian children and adolescents with autism. The young people have continued to have very high levels of emotional and behavioural disturbance and generally do not improve. Parents of children with autism are under significant amounts of stress; reporting high levels of disturbed family functioning and mental health problems. Although there is no cure, children benefit most when early help is provided (under 5 years). There are several promising interventions based on intensive behaviour and educational management, for example requiring 40 hours per week of therapist contact over 2 years. Such programs are costly and impractical as widely available treatment options. Training parents to understand and manage their child also shows promise. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a parent skills training and education treatment program compared to supportive therapy, and to generally available community services. The therapists will follow a treatment manual that will ensure a consistent and replicable approach. The progress of the children with autism and their families will be reassessed immediately after treatment, and at 1 and 2 years post-treatment in order to ascertain immediate and long-term effects of the treatment. If treatment proves to be of use, we will have established a defined, cost efficient, practical and effective model of early treatment that can be easily taught to professionals and widely disseminated throughout early childhood services.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Malaria infection of humans is one of the most important and deadly infectious diseases in the world, killing more than two million people each year. Traditionally, drugs and insecticides have been used to treat the disease and control its spread. Unfortunately, both of these have become much less effective and there now exist untreatable cases of malaria. Alternative control measures are urgently needed and this project focuses on developing a better understanding of how the malaria parasite functions. If important processes such as red blood cell invasion can be understood in detail then it becomes possible to identify proteins essential for survival of the parasite. These could then be used as a vaccine against the disease. Current work suggests that the vaccine will be need more than one parasite protein and it becomes essential to identify the best combination of components. The parasite protein called MSP1 is thought to be a very promising candidate, but it is insufficiently active on its own. We have recently discovered a new protein in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, that is similar to MSP1. We would like to know more about this protein and determine if it may be a useful addition to MSP1 for a vaccine. This project intends to further characterize the properties of this new protein including its role in red blood cell invasion and to examine whether immunization with the rodent malaria form of the protein is able to protect mice against malaria infection. The results of this project will be highly significant in the field of malaria vaccine development and will indicate whether this new protein will be a useful component of the eventual malaria vaccine.',\n",

       "    'description': 'This project involves an investigation of how the bacteria that cause an often fatal wound infection control the production of the toxic proteins that are essential elements of the disease process. In all pathogenic bacteria there are specific genes that encode the virulence factors that are involved in the disease. The expression of these genes is generally controlled by the products of other genes known as regulatory genes. The function of these regulatory networks is generally responsive to environmental stimuli. This project involves the detailed functional analysis of a regulatory network that was first identified in this laboratory and which controls the expression of extracellular toxins that have been implicated in gas gangrene. The overall objectives of the project are to develop a detailed understanding of the mechanisms involved in this regulatory process. Specifically, the project aims to determine the functional components of the regulatory proteins that interact with the environmental signal or which bind to the genes encoding the bacterial toxins, to determine the nature of the target sites to which the regulatory proteins bind, and to examine the hypothesis that there is another regulatory gene that is involved in this process. The project will make a major contribution to our knowledge of the complex interactions that occur between an invading bacterium and the host tissues. If we are to fully comprehend how bacteria cause disease then it is critical that we understand how bacteria control the production of the toxic products that are an integral part of the disease process.',\n",

One of the most pressing difficulties in the management of these conditions is our present inability to accurately predict those women who are destined to have one or other of these serious complications. Unfortunately, this means that the conditions are often detected late with little or no time to offer effective treatments. This project builds on exciting preliminary evidence that suggests that a simple blood test from the mother in early pregnancy may be able to identify the women who will subsequently develop high blood pressure in late pregnancy, or the babies that will suffer impaired growth before delivery. In the future, such knowledge might then allow these women to receive more effective care, thereby improving their chance of a successful pregnancy. The project will also define the best time in pregnancy to perform the blood test and, if successful, could alter the very way women are currently looked after during their pregnancy.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Very premature birth is the commonest cause of illness and death in newborn babies, making it one of the most serious and costly issues in perinatal medicine. The major problem suffered by very premature babies is lung immaturity and its associated harmful effects on brain development. Most very premature babies require resuscitation followed by ventilatory support,often for several weeks. This is extremely expensive and places an enormous financial burden on health care systems. Furthermore, it increases the risks of respiratory illnesses, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia and chronic lung disease which can impair breathing and increase susceptibility to respiratory disease such as asthma later in life. The overall aim of this program is to improve outcomes for very premature babies, including less lung injury, better respiratory health and shorter stays in hospitals. In order to reduce the health burden caused by very premature birth on the community we need to know more about how it alters the normal development of the lungs in the newborn period and into later life. In particular, we need to understand the cellular and molecular processes involved in lung development so that we can identify gene networks and developmental processes that are disrupted by severe premature birth. Such knowledge is necessary to provide a more rational, scientific basis for managing and treating the alterations in lung structure and function caused by premature birth. We also need to develop better ways of resuscitating and ventilating these infants so that lung injury is minimized.The research team is led by two neonatologists and three biomedical research scientists with a proven record of effective collaboration. This team is internationally unique in that it includes practicing neonatologists, respiratory physiologists and molecular biologists who have collaborated together productively and are regarded as world leaders in their respective fields. New talents have been brought into the team to provide expertise in pulmonary stem cell biology, the design of novel steroid drugs, and clinical follow-up. Together, this team has the potential (a) to greatly enhance the understanding of the impact of very premature birth on the developing lung, (b) to improve resuscitation and ventilation techniques, and (c) to translate the new knowledge into clinical practice to improve the outcome for prematurely born babies. Using well characterized animal models we will determine gene networks involved in fetal lung development and how these are altered by premature birth. The successful transition from fetal to postnatal life is critical for survival at birth but more information is needed. Using newborn lambs and rabbits, we will trial novel strategies for enhancing the transformation of the immaturelung into an effective gas exchange organ at birth. New data on lung aeratio',\n",

       "    'description': \"Disruptions to breathing during sleep (snoring), known as sleep disordered breathing occurs in up to 27% of children and forms a continuum of symptoms ranging from mild to severe. It has previously been thought that only severe disruptions to breathing, as occurs in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), were of clinical significance requiring intervention, however recent studies have shown that even snoring with no currently used signs of altered blood oxygenation levels or sleep disruption can have a significant impact on daytime functioning and school performance. It is also known that cardiovascular disease is a long-term consequence of untreated sleep disordered breathing in adults, however the long-term effects on the cardiovascular system in children are unknown. This study will examine both the neurocognitive and cardiovascular effects of a range of severities of sleep disordered breathing in children and will identify new more sensitive markers of sleep disruption in order to predict neurocognitive dysfunction. In order to address this most important issue, this project will combine the expertise of scientists and clinicians in the fields of paediatric sleep, cardiovascular control and neuropsychological assessment from Monash and Melbourne Universities, and the Monash Medical Centre and Royal Children's Hospital.\",\n",

       "    'description': 'Antitrypsin deficiency occurs in approximately 1 in 1800 live births. It is the most common genetic cause of liver disease in children and the debilitating lung disease emphysema in adults. Antitrypsin is produced in the liver and secreted into the circulation. Its primary role is to inhibit the degradative enzyme elastase which attacks the tissues of the lung. A deficiency in Antitrypsin leads to uncontrolled elastase activity which destroys the lung tissue so causing emphysema. The deficiency is commonly caused by Antitrypsin being unable to enter the circulation. This is due to mutations within the Antitrypsin molecule which cause the protein to adopt an incorrect three-dimensional structure. This causes the protein to form long chains within the liver, which in turn damage the liver cell. There are no specific treatments for Antitrypsin deficiency, this partly reflects our lack of understanding of the molecular basis of the disease. This project examines the effects of the mutations upon the folding of Antitrypsin so that we can understand how these long protein chains form. Using a range of biochemical techniques we will monitor structural changes within the normal and abnormal proteins as they fold to determine how the mutations disrupt the process. These data will allow us to begin to rationally design inhibitors which will prevent the formation of the long chains, which we hope will aid in the treatment of patients with Antitrypsin deficiency. This increased understanding of Antitrypsin deficiency may also benefit other disease processes where similar protein misfolding occurs such as amyloid and prion diseases.',\n",

We will characterize these toxins so that we can manipulate them as weapons for controlling infections with multi-drug resistant bacteria.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Cells respond to external signals and the enviroment to undergo cell growth, secretion and or other specialized functions including control of cell death and or cell size. We have identified a new enzyme (72 kDa 5-phosphatase) which resides inside the cell, which we have evidence plays a role in regulating both the movement of intracellular vesicles and also lipid signals stimulated by insulin. We have characterised the phospholipids that the enzyme cleaves and demonstrated the generation of new cell signals at specific subcellular localizations on intracellular membranes. We predict the generation of these specific lipid signals may play a significant role in controlling the transport of intracellular cargo to specific sites in the cell. In this grant proposal we aim to examine the regulation of specialised cargo called the glucose transporter, which is found in fat and muscle cells, and also the mannose 6-phosphate receptor, which regulates the trafficking of specific enzymes which mediate digestion of proteins. These studies include the clarification of which phospholipid signals the enzyme terminates and where in the cell this occurs. Secondly, we will examine the movement of the glucose transporter GLUT-4 in unstimulated cells and in response to insulin and furthermore how expression of the novel enzyme regulates its movement. We will also examine the movement of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor and the specific phospholipid signals which control the route the receptor traffics, using inhibitors of lipid signals and expression of lipid phosphatases and kinases. We will also examine how our novel enzyme forms complexes with other molecules in the cell and characterise these novel molecules using basic biochemical assessment of enzyme activity and function. Finally we will examine the regulation of intracellular messages by our novel enzyme following insulin stimulation, which facilitates glucose uptake into the cell.',\n",

These behaviours are of fundamental importance to animals, and none more so than breathing which must perform effectively from the moment of birth. We plan to examine neural control mechanisms that transform a primitive pattern of breathing in the early gestation fetus into the functional form that effectively ventilates the lungs after birth. In addition to examining the prenatal development of breathing, our program will focus on the developmental fate of a transient behaviour restricted to early development. This early behaviour plays a fundamental role in the development of the motor system before being extinguished under the influence of supraspinal inputs. This program will therefore provide a basis for understanding the mechanisms by which the brain establishes control of the motor circuits of the spinal cord during development. Further, the program is designed to provide a basis for understanding the respiratory problems so common in the preterm human infant.',\n",

Our aim is to examine, over a three year period, the cognitive, attentional and motor performance of presymptomatic gene-positive, and negative, individuals on a wide variety of computerized experimental procedures, which we have previously shown to be sensitive to deficits in individuals who have already been diagnosed with HD. If progressive behavioural changes in gene-positive individuals can be reliably documented to occur before the clinical symptoms of HD are evident, this would be of profound significance as it would allow a set of criteria to be established to assist in early detection of clinical onset of symptoms, and possibly permit use of newly-emerging therapies.\",\n",

       "    'description': 'The maintenance of optimum health and function of living cells, and consequently that of the whole organism, depends on how cells respond to a multitude of physical and chemical stimuli that continually bombard them. The majority of the chemical stimuli such as hormones and neurotransmitters impart their actions not by directly entering the cell, but instead, by binding to a specific receiver protein at the cell surface called a receptor. In one class of such receptors called G protein-coupled receptors, the transmission of the message to the interior of the cell involves yet another protein called G protein. These receptors are the most abundant type of cell surface receptors and form the targets for nearly 50% of currently used therapeutic drugs. It is, therefore, extremely important to unravel how each of these components works, and in particular to know how they work in living cells. This project utilizes state-of-the-art methodologies to examine interactions between receptors and their cognate G proteins, in living cells and in real-time. The work will answer fundamental questions about the nature of G protein-coupled receptor signaling and will aid in the future development of more effective therapeutic agents.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Human embryonic stem cells (ES cells) are cells derived from the early embryo which can be grown in culture for indefinite periods in the primitive embryonic state, while retaining a key feature of the embryonic cells from which they were derived: pluripotentiality, or the ability to give rise to any type of adult tissue cell. Because ES cells represent an unlimited source of any type of human cell, they have great potential for use in research areas such as functional genomics and drug discovery, and in regenerative medicine, the use of transplanted tissue to cure degenerative disease. Our laboratory is one of two in the world to develop human ES cells and the first to demonstrate differentiation of these cells into specialised cells-neurons- in vitro. In order to use ES cells, we need to learn more about how to grow and manipulate them in the laboratory, and how to turn them into desired types of somatic cell. Our study is based on the hypothesis that growth control in human ES cells resembles growth control in the embryo, with interactions between stem cells and their differentiated offspring mediated by signals from membrane bound or soluble proteins directing the differentiation of the stem cells. We have recently identified several key protein regulators of human ES cells. This project will use high throughput analysis of gene expression to pinpoint more candidate regulatory proteins. Then we will use cell culture systems and techniques developed in our laboratory to determine how these proteins may act to control stem cell growth. These studies will result in a greatly improved ability to control stem cells and turn them into specialised cell types for use in research and regenerative medicine. These advances are essential if ES cells are to progress from their current status as an interesting laboratory phenomenon to become a powerful tool for research and medicine.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Shoulder disorders are common, being third only to back and neck complaints as musculoskeletal reasons for medical consultation and they account for 10% of all physiotherapy referrals. The stiff painful shoulder affects up to 2-5% of the general population, being more common in middle age and diabetes. It causes significant pain and disability that restricts activities of daily living as well as work and leisure. Forty percent of sufferers will continue to have symptoms and restricted movements beyond 3 years and 15% will have persistent disability. Because this disease is prevalent, it imposes a considerable burden on the Australian health care system. Shoulder hydrodilatation is a common conservative treatment option that has been shown by our research group to have short-term but not long-term benefits. Physiotherapy may be prescribed following hydrodilatation on the basis that it may maintain the initial benefits seen with hydrodilatation. However, there are no studies to either support or refute this hypothesis. Thus, this novel research project will answer important questions about the efficacy of a physiotherapy program in addition to hydrodilatation for the stiff painful shoulder. We will determine whether physiotherapy offers a benefit over hydrodilatation alone and if so, whether this benefit is sustained. In addition we will determine whether the additional costs of physiotherapy represent good value for money. The results of this project can then be easily and immediately translated into clinical practice as recommendations can be made about the usefulness of physiotherapy for this patient population. The results will be of major benefit not just to the physiotherapy profession but to the medical profession who must justify patient referral to physiotherapy.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Transport of key proteins that regulate growth and other processes, into and out of the nucleus, the site of gene transcription, is central to the function of eukaryotic cells. Knowledge of the process is largely based on studies using semi-intact cell systems, however, meaning that the role of cytoskeletal elements in nuclear transport has been largely overlooked. Intriguingly, in vivo studies, including our own relating to signalling molecules important in the regulation of cancer, clearly implicate the cellular microtubule (MT) network as playing an integral role in nuclear import. We propose to carry out a detailed examination of the mechanistic basis of the dependence of nuclear import on the MT network of 3 molecules regulating cancer. We will compare the properties of these molecules to those of other nuclear localizing molecules, as well as examine the ability to mediate nuclear import of similar MT-associating sequences from viral and other proteins. The results will establish for the first time, the generality of the dependence of nuclear protein import on cytoskeletal elements. Since the movement of large DNA molecules by simple diffusion is a limiting factor in non-viral gene delivery approaches, the possibility of applying this knowledge to facilitate the transport of DNA encoding therapeutic gene products to the nucleus of target cells, will also be assessed for the first time. We will use the modular sequences that confer interaction with the MT network to assist gene transfer by including them in modular constructs we have designed with this in mind. We will thus be able to test directly for the first time whether MT-interaction can enhance the delivery of DNA to the nucleus and reporter gene expression, with obvious application in gene therapy approaches.',\n",

       "    'description': \"We are trialling the implementation of an innovative telephone-delivered program for managing people who have had a heart attack. Cardiac rehabilitation programs are generally based in hospitals in Australia and people have to be able to attend the programs when they are offered. Even though such programs have been shown to be very effective in improving outcomes after a heart attack, at least 85% of Australians after a heart attack are either unable to access and-or unable to attend such programs due to transport and many other barriers. So, there is an urgent need to identify new, effective, and affordable ways of delivering cardiac rehabilitation programs to people after a heart attack. The proposed telephone-delivered program will be particularly appropriate for disadvantaged people, such as those living in rural and remote areas as well as Indigenous Australians, who do not currently have access to hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation programs. People who have had a heart attack will be recruited from three of Brisbane's largest public teaching hospitals, and will then be randomly assigned to the telephone-delivered cardiac rehabilitation program (Care Management Intervention group) or to a control or Usual Care group. The Care Management Intervention group will receive regular telephone calls from a highly qualified 'Care Manager' based at the renowned National Heart Foundation of Australia telephone support service, 'Heartline'. The Care Manager will help people to manage their heart condition and prevent the reoccurrence of further heart problems. People will also be encouraged to make necessary lifestyle and behavioural changes with the assistance of the Care Manager and some Heart Foundation educational and interactive resources to record their progress. We expect that the program or Care Management Intervention group will have better health outcomes than the control or Usual Care group at 6 and 12 months follow up.\",\n",

       "    'description': 'The major breakdown products of the steroid hormone, progesterone, form a group of hormones termed neuroactive steroids. These steroids have major effects on the activity of the brain and influence behaviour in adult subjects. Changes in the production of steroids by the steroid producing glands influences neurosteroid levels in the adult brain. This in tern may cause behavioural and mood changes in adults, leading to conditions such as premenstrual stress and postnatal depression. In fetal life, the placenta releases large amounts of these neuroactive steroids and high concentrations of these steroid are found in the fetal circulation. We have shown that these steroids suppress the activity of the fetal brain, suppress arousal and maintain the fetus in a sleep-like state during pregnancy. In this proposal we investigate the hypothesis that cells in the fetal brain modify the neuroactive steroid environment within the brain so as to suppress fetal brain activity further during times of stress and, therefore, protect the brain from damage caused by excessive excitation. These mechanisms may prevent brain injury due to placental insufficiency during pregnancy and asphyxia during birth. The augmentation of these natural processes may form the bases for treatment strategies to provide additional protection for the fetal brain in high-risk pregnancies.',\n",

They will study the interactions between circulating white blood cells (leukocytes) which originate from the bone marrow , and intrinsic kidney cells in the development of tis disease. Inflammation is the result of recruitment of bone marrow derived inflammatory cells and plasma proteins to a variety of stimuli. The subsequent injury represents the interaction between recruited cells and local cells within the target organ. Glomerulonephritis is an important human disease where both bone marrow derived inflammatory and local cells have the potential to contribute to kidney injury by production of signalling molecules called cytokines.

       "    'description': 'This proposal aims to determine the molecular structure of the two known isoforms of Glutamate Decarboxylase (GAD65 and GAD67). GAD in an essential human enzyme that is responsible for synthesising the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA functions in the human Central Nervous System (CNS) to dampen down excitatory signals. Proper control of GABA synthesis is important and perturbations in GABA levels lies behind human diseases such as intractable epilepsy, depression and schizophrenia. As a result of this role, numerous common therapeutics (for example benzodiazepines) target proteins involved in the GABA neurotransmitter system. The goal of this proposal is to use the molecular structures of GAD to understand how to achieve fine control of GABA production. In addition to its role in the CNS, GAD is an important human autoantigen. Antibodies to one isoform of GAD, GAD65, are found in most patients with type I diabetes as well as certain patients with the movement disorder stiff person syndrome and related diseases of the CNS. It is suggested that the development of auto-antibodies may play a key role in the pathophysiology of these conditions. Despite sharing >80% sequence similarity with GAD65, autoantibodies to the other isoform of GAD, GAD67, are rarely found in patients with disease. The aim of this grant is to characterise the region of GAD that is targetted by autoantibodes. These data will allow us to understand why certain autoantibodes are able to inhibit GAD enzyme activity and why GAD65, but not GAD67 is recognised by autoantibodes.',\n",

       "    'description': \"Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive disorder clinically characterized by the onset of involuntary jerky movements, impaired voluntary movements, cognitive-attentional deterioration, and psychiatric symptoms. It is a consequence of progressive and selective brain degeneration. Over the last decade our research unit has made significant progress in describing the cognitive deficits in HD; however, we still don't know much about the parts of the brain that underlie these deficits. The aim of this project is to use event related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to correlate structural and functional changes in the brain via the use of various cognitive behavioural measures. In this way we can elucidate what brain areas are responsible for various cognitive functions. In addition, we intend to ascertain how different brain areas decrement in function over time and to determine whether there is a relationship between rate of disease progression, age at onset and certain genetic characteristics. Understanding how the brain functions and how the disease progresses over time will be essential, from the point of view of patient management, when new drug treatments eventually permit prevention of the development, or slows further progress, of the disorder.\",\n",

Leptospira are shed from infected animals via the urine; human infection may occur through contact with infected urine or urine contaminated materials. In Australia, leptospirosis is an occupational hazard with dairy farmers, pig handlers, banana pickers and abattoir workers being those most at risk. A recent and alarming development is the emergence of new risk groups associated with certain leisure activities. For example, in the USA three triathletes died from leptospirosis and it was subsequently determined that the source of infection was contaminated swimming water. This project will investigate aspects of the development of disease and immunity during infection by Leptospira. This will be achieved by analysing the set of proteins located on the surface of the bacterium. These proteins play a key role in the development of disease. Using state of the art technology, each of the proteins will be purified and identified. This will enable experiments that will enhance our understanding of the development of disease at a molecular level.',\n",

       "    'description': \"Warfarin is a drug commonly used in the elderly to prevent blood clots. Blood clots can lead to stroke. While a very effective drug, it is also a dangerous drug because it can lead to thin blood which makes it more likely that they will bleed. For this reason, the drug should be closely monitored. We know that many people do suffer catastrophic bleeds because the blood is too thin directly as a result of taking warfarin. Some of the reasons for these bleeds are well known; they may be taking drugs that interact with warfarin, they may have problems with their liver or kidney which affects the body's ability to get rid of it, they may have suffered a fall, to name a few. Studies done overseas have suggested that people are more likely to have a bleed if they do not know how to properly manage their tablets, if they are depressed, if they have no helpers to support them or if their care is not well organised. In Australia, we do not know what impact the organisation of care has on whether a person's warfarin is well managed. We do not know the impact that depression has on their care, or whether people are more likely to have pooorly controlled warfarin if they have few community ties. These are importnat questions to answer, so that we can make significant inroads into preventing death and disability from warfarin.\",\n",

The project involves the detailed analysis of the process by which this bacterium controls the production of the toxic proteins that are required for disease to occur. The emphasis is to determine the mechanism by which this regulatory process is mediated. Research in this laboratory has identified two genes whose protein products are the key links in this regulatory network. The objectives of the project will be to determine which part of the regulatory protein interacts with the target toxin gene, to start to determine the structure of the regulatory protein so that the precise biochemical mechanism of action can be ascertained, to determine the components of the DNA target that are essential for binding activity, and to identify other genes that are involved in the regulation of both the toxin genes and other genes that may be implicated in the disease process. These studies will be facilitated by the availability of the complete genome sequence of this pathogenic bacterium. The project will make a major contribution to our knowledge of how bacteria that cause disease are able to control the production of the toxins that are critical to the disease process. If we are to learn how to more effectively control and treat bacterial infections then it is very important that we understand the complex regulatory networks that tell bacteria when to produce its disease-causing products.',\n",

This study aims to study the effect of Botox in a larger group of people with MS and will include detailed MRI scans and electrical tremor monitoring tests to define the underlying changes in the brain that causes tremor. The results will help make Botox available as a tremor treatment for people with MS.',\n",

Anti-hypertensive treatments are available, but must usually be taken for the rest of the patient's life and the cost to the taxpayer of anti-hypertensive drugs is greater than for any other health problem. Prevention of high blood pressure depends on identifying the initial cause - but we still do not know the cause in over 90% of hypertensive people. This project will study whether overactivity of the nerves to the blood vessels of the kidney might be the cause. There is evidence for this in humans, and in a strain of rats which develops high blood pressure (the spontaneously hypertensive rat). Our experiments will study these rats to see whether nerves affect the structure and function of the blood vessels of the kidney in ways that lead to increased blood pressure.\",\n",

       "    'description': \"High blood pressure is a condition afflicting more than 10% of our community, and is the leading risk factor for stroke and heart disease. The kidneys play a critical role in control of blood pressure under normal conditions, and probably also in the initiation and maintenance of high blood pressure. This influence is exerted both through the excretion of salt and water, and by the release of substances into the circulation that affect blood pressure (hormones). Recent experiments performed by us and others have indicated that the inner part of the kidney (the medulla) is critical in these functions, which appear to be regulated by the level of blood flow in the medulla of the kidney. Our recent experiments also show that hormones and nerves have diverse effects on blood flow in the different regions of the kidney, showing that these factors can differentially affect blood pressure depending on their effects on medullary blood flow. Importantly, these hormones and nerves do not act in isolation, but act in concert, and in association with so called 'second messenger' systems that act locally to directly affect the contraction of muscle in blood vessels, and so blood vessel size. The experiments described in this application are aimed at determining how circulating and locally acting hormones, and the nerves in the kidney, interact together to control blood flow in the different regions of the kidney. This will help us understand how blood flow to the medulla of the kidney is regulated normally, so that we can begin to understand how malfunction of these systems can contribute to the development of high blood pressure.\",\n",

       "    'description': 'Couch grass pollen is increasingly important in Australia and other temperate and subtropical regions as a seasonal allergen causing asthma and hay fever. In our allergy clinic 85% of patients with seasonal asthma and-or hay fever are allergic to both couch grass pollen and rye grass pollen. Standard allergy treatment shots usually cover the rye grass pollen allergens but there is no cross-reactivity with couch grass pollen and therefore symptoms due to couch grass pollen are not controlled. These shots are seldom used in asthmatic patients because of the risk of severe asthma or generalised allergic reactions. We plan to examine human blood cell responses to couch grass pollen allergens before and after allergy shots with a preparation that includes couch grass pollen and rye grass pollen. A comparable control group of patients receiving only drug therapy will also be investigated. This study will identify dominant sites of couch grass pollen allergen immunoreactivity and reveal mechanisms of desensitisation. Based on this information, we will develop novel couch grass pollen proteins that retain the positive features needed for a successful desensitising vaccine but without the ability to bind to allergy antibodies and possibly cause severe adverse events such as asthma attacks. These preparations could be used to provide safer and more effective allergy treatments that can be used in hay fever sufferers and asthmatics.',\n",

Once bound, these antibodies can activate other parts of the immune system, which help destroy the foreign substance. Analogous to the situation above, a number of institutions are testing antibodies that bind to cancer cells, in order to determine if they are able to destroy these cells. It is also possible to generate antibodies that bind to receptors on the surface of cancer cells and block their function. If you target a receptor critical to the growth or survival of a cancer cell in this way, then swtiching-off this signal may inhibit tumor growth. In this proposal we plan to test a panel antibodies that recognize receptors important to the growth of brain cancer. Two of these antibodies have been generated and the other two will be made as part of this proposal. A key aspect of this proposal will be testing these antibodies in combination to determine how many receptors need to be targeted in order to get complete tumor regressions in animal models. Overall this work will help us identify new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of brain cancer. Finally, we will also analyze the way different receptors interact together in brain cancer cells.',\n",

       "    'description': 'Alzheimer s disease, a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder suffered by many of our elderly, is characterised by the presence of abnormal protein accumulations called plaques in the brains of affected patients. Plaques contain amyloid protein and also have high levels of the essential metals copper and zinc. Copper is needed for the formation of these protein aggregations and increases the toxic effects of amyloid, leading to the idea that copper-binding chemicals could be used to treat Alzheimer s disease. However experiments in animal models have produced conflicting results, some suggesting that increased copper levels protect against neuronal damage while others claim the opposite effect. Comparison of these studies is hampered by the different experimental systems used. We will clarify the role of copper in the progression of Alzheimer s disease using a simple insect model, the fly Drosophila melanogaster. Production of amyloid in Drosophila neuronal tissues produces a neurodegenerative effect similar to that seen in human brains, but in a matter of weeks rather than the years required in humans. We will combine production of amyloid with production of copper uptake and export proteins to investigate the effect of changing copper levels. We will also test the effect of increasing copper and other metals in the diet to see whether dietary levels are an important factor in disease progression. Finally, we will use the Drosophila model to test large numbers of metal binding compounds and drugs for ones that slow or halt the neuronal damage caused by amyloid production, identifying potential therapeutics for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease. This work will provide a vital and definitive clarification of the role of copper in the progression of Alzheimer s disease and potentially lead to the development of novel treatments for this disease that is rapidly becoming a major social and economic problem in the developed world.',\n",

       "    'description': \"The cells of the blood play an important role in maintaining healthy blood vessels. We are interested in two types of blood cells, platelets and leukocytes, which together play a key role in vessel maintenance, by promoting blood clot formation and vessel wall repair following injury. However, while critical for normal blood vessel maintenance, these cells have also been demonstrated to contribute to disease states including atherosclerosis, thrombosis and inflammatory airway diseases. Underlying the function of both blood cell types is their ability to stick (or adhere) to each other. However the way in which they coordinate this adhesion is very complex. New information from our laboratory has demonstrated that the sticky behaviour of each cell type is spatially and temporally regulated, and may involve may factors both inside and outside of the cells themselves. Our studies aim to define the key components regulating the 'stickiness' of these blood cells, in order to undertand how they contribute to maintaining healthy vessel walls, but also how their stickiness may also contribute to the promotion of diseased vessels. This information will not only increase our knowledge of the factors that regulate blood clot formation, but may also assist in the development of new therapies to prevent and-or treat vessel disease.\",\n",

This is achieved by an interconnected network of brain nuclei that sense information from the major blood vessels and integrate appropriate responses to maintain the status quo. Chemicals called neurotransmitters convey the nervous messages, and one such example is purines, which include ATP and adenosine. Both ATP and adenosine can act in a number of brain regions to modulate blood pressure and heart rate. This project is designed to characterise the mechanism by which purines act within specific brain nuclei to regulate the cardiovascular system. Considering the large economic burden on the healthcare system caused by cardiovascular disease, this research is vital to increase our understanding of how diseases such as hypertension may be caused, and therefore provide improved therapeutic strategies.',\n",

The 'area' that has received the most funding is 'medical and health science'. It should be noted that many of these grants list more than one area of research in the source data. However, the results are still meaningful and provide both broad and more specific indicators (as one moves down the x-axis) of the research receiving the most grants. The number of grants should also be considered in the context of the dollar value of these grants. This aspect will be represented in the next visualisation."
