Modulation of receptors, therefore, forms a key target in our ability to treat disease. The largest class of receptors is the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which transmit signals within a cell via proteins called G proteins. GPCRs form between 1 and 5% of the entire repertoire of human genes. One group of GPCRs provide the target for small protein molecules that cirulate through the body. One such circulating molecule is calcitonin, a peptide that plays an important role in maintaining circulating calcium levels in the body, which is essential for proper maintenance of the skeleton. As a consequence of this action, calcitonin is an important clinically used tool in the treatment of bone disease such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease. Due to the molecular nature of calcitonin and its receptors (and other related receptors) that have a broad, complex mechanism of interaction, we have very little definitive information on how calcitonin interfaces with its receptor to signal to target cells. The current project utilises a novel method of permanently linking calcitonin to its receptor, allowing identification of how the two components come together. Furthermore, the project will explore the functional consequence of naturally occuring genetic variation (genotype) and also examine whether the occurence of specific calcitonin receptor genotype is correlated with disease markers for osteoporosis and obesity. This information provides important fundamentals for understanding how this and related receptors work and the potential for rational design of improved theraupeutic tools.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Prof Laurence Miller", "Prof Patrick Sexton", "Prof Ruben Abagyan"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 382821, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2007, "endDate": 2008, "dateTimeModified": "2015-05-06T15:59:24Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T16:57:14Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Patrick Sexton"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436780", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436780", "436780"], "subjects": ["060108 060111", "G-protein coupled receptors", "calcitonin", "ligand binding", "molecular modelling", "receptor activation", "Osteoporosis", "diabetes", "pain", "reproduction"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/100720"}]}, {"id": "1319494", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1141551", "type": "grant", "title": "Improving Drug Delivery Using Nanotechnology", "description": "In this fellowship I will develop methods to improve the way drugs are delivered through the use of nanotechnology.

From the anatomical viewpoint, each of these areas should be capable of receiving visual information independently, through parallel anatomical channels involving the brainstem. Yet, it has been observed that lesion of one particular area (the primary visual area, V1) results in loss of vision. This raises several questions. What type of visual information is carried by the parallel pathways to the other visual areas? Why aren t these other areas capable of sustaining vision without V1? Do V1 lesions trigger changes in the adult brain, which affect the other visual areas? As a step towards answering these questions, we will study the neural pathways that convey visual information directly to the middle temporal area (MT). MT is one of the best-characterised visual areas, and the anatomy of its neural inputs is well known, facilitating the interpretation of the results. We will investigate the type of visual information being sent to MT after lesions of V1, as well as the changes in the electrical responses of MT cells which result from this type of condition. This is a basic science study, the primary benefit of which will be advancement of knowledge on the mechanisms that underlie visual processing in normal and pathological situations. However, this type of work may also lay the groundwork for developments in areas of applied research.

Consequently there are no therapies available to overcome the detrimental effects of stress on reproduction. Stress can take many forms, such as psychological stress, surgical trauma, strenuous exercise, undernutrition, all of which may inhibit reproduction. We now know that males and females respond differently to stress and we have shown that stress is also likely to have different effects on reproduction in males and females. In this project we aim to determine how stress impairs reproduction in males and females. A major effect of stress appears to be to inhibit the secretion of a substance produced by the brain that is necessary for the regulation of reproduction. This substance is called gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) and it acts on a small gland at the base of the brain to cause the release of hormones that are essential for reproduction in both males and females. It is also possible that stress may inhibit the actions of GnRH. Our research suggests that there may be differences between males and females in the extent to which stress inhibits the secretion of GnRH from the brain and its actions to cause the release of other reproductive hormones. In this project we will determine how stress acts in the brain to affect the secretion and actions of GnRH in males and females.

The sensation of muscle force depends on two factors. One, a sense of the effort required to perform a task, is generated in the central nervous system and. The other, a sense of the force actually developed by the muscles, is generated in the muscles themselves by signals from sensory receptors called Golgi tendon organs. The sensation of muscle force and the heaviness of objects results from a combination of both senses, but the contribution of each is unknown. The aim of the project is to determine whether the disturbance of force sense in fatigued muscles results from changes in the way tendon organs signal the actual force developed by the muscles. This will be important for understanding how force sense is disturbed following exercise and in disease states, and for understanding the normal way muscle force is sensed in everyday situations. Disturbances of force sense after exercise will be documented in human subjects by asking them to generate what they perceive to be equal forces in both arms or legs, before and after one limb only is exercised. Errors in force estimation will show up as mismatches between the two limbs. The difficulty with human experiments is that the signals generated by tendon organs cannot be measured directly, but only inferred, perhaps wrongly. This difficulty will be overcome by measuring tendon organ activity directly in anaesthetised animals, where the muscles will be electrically stimulated to perform exercise similar to that in the human experiments. A change in tendon organ signalling will be taken to mean that similar changes in humans could be responsible for disturbances of force sense. In further experiments, the mechanism of the changes will be explored.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["John Gregory", "Prof David Morgan", "Prof Uwe Proske"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 181320, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2002, "endDate": 2004, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-11T08:22:41Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T13:43:19Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["John Gregory"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194307", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194307", "194307"], "subjects": ["Medical virology", "Medical microbiology", "BIOMEDICAL AND CLINICAL SCIENCES", "Eccentric exercise", "Golgi tendon organs", "Motor control", "Proprioception and kinaesthesia", "Somatosensory system", "Basic science", "Biological sciences", "Proprioception - abnormality", "Sensory function"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/78230"}]}, {"id": "101024", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/971455", "type": "grant", "title": "Biosensor equipment for on-line measurement of binding constants and kinetics", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Prof Milton T W Hearn"], "description": null, "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 50000, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Infrastructure Grants", "startDate": 1997, "endDate": 1997, "dateTimeModified": "2015-05-06T16:00:48Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T16:57:32Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/971455", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/971455", "971455"], "subjects": ["Not Applicable"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/101024"}]}, {"id": "98766", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/900905", "type": "grant", "title": "Analysis of the structural requirements for antigen pre sentation to T lymphocytes", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Dr Francis R Carbone"], "description": null, "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 124779.9, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 1990, "endDate": 1993, "dateTimeModified": "2015-05-06T15:51:01Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T16:46:15Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/900905", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/900905", "900905"], "subjects": ["tcell recognition", "protein structure", "peptides", "antigen presentation", "mhc", "Basic Science", "IMMUNOLOGY", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/98766"}]}, {"id": "115904", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/545888", "type": "grant", "title": "The prevention and optimal treatment of Type II Diabetes", "description": "Lifestyle related metabolic disease including obesity and diabetes, represent a disease continuum and present an increasing public health challenge.

We will also explore the means by which these packages of nasty DNA transfer between bacteria and investigate their potential to give rise to new, more virulent strains of bacteria. This study is particularly significant because it will lead to an improved understanding of how bacteria cause disease and may help to guide us in developing better strategies for the prevention of bacterial diarrhoea.

The United Kingdom is set to make these and other performance indicators on the ability of surgeons ('report cards') available from 2004. There are good reasons to think a similar system may be introduced in Australia in the near future. Patients can use the information contained in report cards when deciding whether or not to consent to have a particular surgeon conduct an operation on them. Contemporary bioethicists stress the importance of a proper informed consent process in medicine. This is a process in which a doctor advises a patient of relevant information and ensures that the patient comprehends that information, before the patient consents to an operation. Currently report cards in America are publicly disseminated on the internet, however there is no systematic attempt to incorporate the information contained in report cards into the informed consent process. We do not know if patients understand the information they are given, or if they incorporate it into their decision making procedures appropriately. In our study we will consider how information that is contained in report cards could best be used in the informed consent process. We will keep in mind the importance of helping patients to make their own informed decisions to consent to operations, the importance of respecting the professional integrity of surgeons and the importance of providing the best possible standard of care for patients.

While progress has been made on prevention and early diagnosis, no curative treatment exists for stage IV melanoma.

In this context, Eph receptor tyrosine kinases (Ephs) and their membrane-bound ephrin ligands are crucial mediators of cell adhesion and motility and are notably overexpressed in metastatic tumours rather than primary (benign) lesions5. Our laboratories were the first to identify EphA3 7, and one of the first to isolate its ligand, ephrin-A5. EphA3 was isolated from acute lymphoblastoid leukemia and malignant melanoma patients, where increasing expression levels correlate with metastatic progression. Soluble, non-clustered forms of Ephs and ephrins are effective inhibitors of Eph activity 3 and provide opportunities to generate specific drugs for cancer therapy.

The combination of the current epidemic of obesity in Western countries and the aging of the population is likely to have a synergistic effect on the prevalence and incidence of knee OA. Despite the consistent relationship between obesity and OA, little work has been done on the relationship between obesity and biomechanical factors such as knee angle and muscle mass and how these may interact with obesity and weight loss in modifying the risk of knee OA. It may be that weight loss programs could be more effective at reducing the risk of OA if they are combined with programs aimed at correcting muscle weakness and malalignment.

Around 8% of patients consulting a GP also have panic disorder (PD). A further 10% of the community experience spontaneous panic, but do not have full PD (termed non-clinical panic). People with PD frequently experience clinical depression, about 15% abuse alcohol and non-prescription drugs and PD is associated with an increased risk of suicide. Over time people with PD appear to have an increased risk of heart problems. They also have substantial financial burdens through multiple attendances at doctors' rooms and through restricted employment opportunities. Only just over one in four people with an anxiety disorder consults a health professional for their problems, with most going to their GP. It has been estimated that less than 10% of these people seek the services of a mental health specialist such as a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist. Therefore because of blocks to do with access, cost or embarrassment, many people with mental health problems do not seek face-to-face specialised mental health treatment. People in rural and regional Australia are particularly disadvantaged by limited access to these specialists. We have developed an internet-based treatment program on panic and anxiety for people in the community, and particularly in regional Australia. Early evaluation of this program has found it is more effective than other types of therapist-assisted self-help treatment. The aim of this research project is to compare it to best-practice face-to-face psychological and pharmacological treatment for PD. If the effectiveness of our internet-based treatment is comparable to best-practice face-to-face treatment, its availability will assist the many Australians who suffer from debilitating panic but who are unable to access specialised mental health assistance.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Dr Litza Kiropoulos", "Mr David Austin", "Prof Britt Klein"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 202575, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2003, "endDate": 2005, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-11T08:35:14Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T16:45:38Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Britt Klein"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250600", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/250600", "250600"], "subjects": ["Vision science", "Ophthalmology and optometry", "BIOMEDICAL AND CLINICAL SCIENCES", "behavioural intervention", "internet-based therapy", "mental health", "information systems - clinical", "panic disorder", "rural health"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/97935"}]}, {"id": "662386", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1098480", "type": "grant", "title": "Endogenous oestrogen is a key missing link in urethral hypospadias", "description": "Defects in penis development are among the most common birth abnormalities, and affect around 1 in every 150 live male births in Australia.

In many cases, these cysts lead to kidney failure. Once the kidneys fail irreversibly, the only treatments available are dialysis and kidney transplantation. Dialysis to remove waste products from the blood is time consuming and does not completely replace all functions of the kidney. Kidney transplantation is limited by the availability of donor organs. At present, there are no reliable ways to prevent the onset or slow the progression of PKD. The kidney consists of a complex system of tubules and ducts. PKD causes the cells that make up these tubules and ducts to grow uncontrollably and form cysts. We are using mice to study how mutations affect the mechanisms that control cell growth in the kidney and cause PKD. Bone marrow cells can move to the kidney and repair it after damage. We will test if bone marrow cells carrying a PKD mutation can cause PKD when transplanted into a healthy mouse. This will help us learn how mutations cause PKD in humans. We will also see if normal bone marrow can prevent disease when transplanted into a mutant mouse that spontaneously develops PKD. This experiment may lay the basis for a way to treat human PKD.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Dr James Deane"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 349250, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2005, "endDate": 2007, "dateTimeModified": "2015-05-06T15:45:35Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T16:45:14Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Dr James Deane"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334130", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334130", "334130"], "subjects": ["Cell Development, Proliferation and Death", "BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES", "BIOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY", "bone marrow transplantation", "cilia", "polycystic kidney disease", "tubular epithelium", "autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease", "autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease", "end stage renal disease"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/97518"}]}, {"id": "111982", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1047918", "type": "grant", "title": "Pathogenic consequences and mechanistic insights of daptomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus", "description": "Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common human bacterial pathogens.

Sepsis occurs in 1 of 50 hospital admissions and is the leading cause of death n intensive care units. The instance of sepsis has doubled in the last decade and is expected to increase. One of the major causes of sepsis si lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the main constituent of gram-negative bacteria's cell wall, and the prototypic inducer of the pro-inflammatory response of the innate immune system. Dysregulation of the pro-inflammatory response can lead to sepsis. Recently, the mammalian receptor for LPS was found to be Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, the activation of which activates a signal transduction pathway that initiates the pro-inflammatory response. We have previously shown a key role for an adapter protein called Mal in mediating signal transduction pathways upon activation of TLR-4. Interaction of Mal with a key signal transduction mediator called TRAF6 has been shown to induce the activation of the pro-inflammatory response. Furthermore, Mal has been found to undergo degradation which may indicate a means of regulating the continued activation of the pro-inflammatory pathway. This research program will investigate the role of Mal in mediating signal transduction in TLR activated macrophages, key responsive cells of the innate immune system to microbial infection. A greater understanding of these processes will assist in the development of therapeutics to alleviate the consequences of microbial-induced inflammation, including chronic inflammatory diseases and sepsis.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["A/Pr Ashley Mansell"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 472500, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2005, "endDate": 2007, "dateTimeModified": "2015-05-06T15:36:26Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T15:56:28Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["A/Pr Ashley Mansell"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334023", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334023", "334023"], "subjects": ["Cellular Immunology", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "IMMUNOLOGY", "Endotoxin-elicited response", "Inflammation", "Innate Immunity", "NF-kappa B (NF-kB)", "Signaling pathways", "cell signaling", "infection/acute inflammation", "innate immunity", "septic shock"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/95023"}]}, {"id": "1319215", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1140313", "type": "grant", "title": "Type 2 immunity: a regulator of physiology, tissue repair and metabolism", "description": "Intestinal helminths (worms) have evolved together with humans and induce strong type 2 immune responses effective at eradicating the parasite, mediating tissue repair and modulating the gut microbiota.

Disorders arising from such spasms include sudden death, neurological deficits, visual and hearing loss or impairment, Raynaud's phenomenon (painful episodic contraction of the fingers and toes) and intestinal necrosis. Common mechanisms are likely to underlie the spasms associated with these disparate disorders. In a recent electrophysiological study of vascular smooth muscle, we discovered a novel membrane current which we refer to as the plateau current. This current has a strong depolarizing influence that is likely to make a major contribution to the spasms, particularly in arterioles and small arteries which are more dependent on depolarization for contraction. Block of this current is expected to minimize the depolarization and therefore prevent or ameliorate spasm of the vessels. Thus the plateau current represents a new field of therapeutic potential for addressing vascular problems that have significant health implications. However, therapeutic manipulation of the current requires knowledge of its properties. In this project we will determine the biophysical and pharmacological properties of this current using voltage-clamp techniques. We will then use this information to assess its functional significance by recording membrane potential with intracellular microelectrodes simultaneously with contractile activity. We will also compare small vessels obtained from volunteers with or without the vasospastic disorder of Raynaud's phenomenon. Our previous work using these techniques was described in J Physiol as a microelectrode, patch clamp and myograph study of the highest quality and of supreme technical difficulty and scored a Top-Ten hit rate. Since we are the only ones to record the plateau current, we are in a unique position to make significant progress to our understanding of contraction, including spasm, in small blood vessels.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Dr Harold Coleman", "Dr Marianne Tare", "Prof Barry Mcgrath", "Prof Helena Parkington"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 287500, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2005, "endDate": 2007, "dateTimeModified": "2015-05-06T15:55:44Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T16:56:30Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Dr Harold Coleman"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334162", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334162", "334162"], "subjects": ["Cardiology (incl.

Hypertrophy is initiated by a population of immature muscle cells known as myoblasts which fuse to form myotubes, and then mature to form muscle fibers (differentiation). Many proteins involved in a cascade of activation and-or deactivation are important for regulating hypertrophy (hypertrophic signaling). Failure of skeletal muscle to induce hypertrophy can lead to muscle degeneration. The FHL proteins are highly expressed in skeletal muscle. FHL proteins are molecular scaffolds which direct assembly of protein complexes to form the muscle contraction machinery (sarcomere). We propose FHL proteins will initiate-regulate skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Increased levels of FHL1 correlate with skeletal muscle hypertrophy. However, it is unclear if increased FHL1 is alone sufficient to induce hypertrophy directly. We have genetically engineered mice to express elevated levels of FHL1 specifically in skeletal muscles (FHL1 transgenic mice) and these mice show muscle enlargement. FHL1 transgenic mice have larger muscle fibers and are >7-fold stronger than non-transgenic littermates. We are currently examining which cell signaling pathways are affected by elevated FHL1. We are also investigating the role of another family member FHL3 in the differentiation of immature myoblasts, a process essential for both embryonic and postnatal skeletal muscle (hypertrophy) development. In the cell nucleus, FHL2 regulates genes which control cell growth and death and increased nuclear levels of FHL2 been detected in prostate cancer biopsies. Recently we demonstrated that FHL2 binds and is sequestered from the nucleus, by a protein, filamin. We are investigating the FHL2-mediated regulation of genes in human melanoma cells, which due to gene mutation are devoid of filamin and will determine how this affects FHL2 function in muscle.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Prof Christina Mitchell", "Prof Edna Hardeman"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 517960.06, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2007, "endDate": 2009, "dateTimeModified": "2015-05-06T16:16:39Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T14:47:23Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Christina Mitchell"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436637", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436637", "436637"], "subjects": ["Neurosciences not elsewhere classified", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "NEUROSCIENCES", "cell differentiation", "gene knockout", "muscle", "nuclear-cytoplasmic transport", "transcriptional regulation", "hypertrophy", "muscle atrophy", "muscle development", "musculoskeletal", "skeletal muscle"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/82082"}]}, {"id": "100306", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/950780", "type": "grant", "title": "Remodelling in airways disease", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["A/Pr John W Wilson"], "description": null, "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 215508.19, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 1995, "endDate": 1998, "dateTimeModified": "2015-05-06T15:58:08Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T16:56:55Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/950780", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/950780", "950780"], "subjects": ["mast cells", "cystic fibrosis", "cytokines", "inflammation", "asthma", "Clinical Medicine and Science", "Respiratory Diseases & Sciences"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/100306"}]}, {"id": "1319503", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1141564", "type": "grant", "title": "Characterization of novel, colitis associated pathobionts to identify therapeutic targets in the host immune response", "description": "Applying cutting edge methods to grow bacteria from the human gut, we have identified three species, two previously unknown, that are found in many inflammatory diseases including Inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer and in cancer immunotherapy patients who experience colitis.

It classically causes disease of the small bowel, resulting in impaired absorption of important nutrients, and is treated by a restrictive diet eliminating foods containing extracts of these grains. However, it has recently been found that CD is much commoner than previously thought (about 1 in 100-200), and often causes only non-specific symptoms. Two important conditions linked to CD by some, but not all, researchers are ataxia (incoordination) and impairment of thinking and memory. The problem is that many normal people (12% of the population) have antibodies to gluten, so that studies suggesting that sensitivity to gluten, as determined by the presence of antibodies, causes these brain disorders are not conclusive. That is, this could be a chance association. Furthermore, there is some evidence that damage to the coordination part of the brain (the cerebellum) from other causes may also cause antibodies to gluten. It is quite possible that antibodies to the cerebellum can cross-react with gluten, and vice versa. In this case, treating patients with ataxia and antibodies to gluten with the restrictive diet may be treating the result rather than the cause of the disorder. This project will study patients with CD (proven on small bowel biopsy) with sensitive, objective methods, including MRI, electronic measures of coordination, and psychological tests of thinking and memory, to see whether CD really is associated with these two problems. It will also study coordination and brain structure in a mouse model of CD. If the associations are proven, all patients with these disorders will need to be tested for CD, and treated with the restrictive diet if found to be positive. If not, clinicians will be confident that testing for anti-gluten antibodies would be irrelevant and misleading in these two situations.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Dr Robert Anderson", "Prof Elsdon Storey", "Prof Glynda Kinsella", "Prof Mark Cook"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 606013.06, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2007, "endDate": 2009, "dateTimeModified": "2015-05-06T15:38:02Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T15:57:01Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Elsdon Storey"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436791", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436791", "436791"], "subjects": ["Neurology and Neuromuscular Diseases", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "NEUROSCIENCES", "autoantibodies", "celiac disease", "cerebellum", "cognitive impairment", "transgenic animals", "ataxia", "clinical diagnosis and assessment", "coeliac disease", "volumetric magnetic resonance imaging"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/95782"}]}, {"id": "1345295", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/GNT1079611", "type": "grant", "title": "Protein-RNA interactions in antiviral cellular defence and gene regulation", "description": "Protein-RNA interactions play key roles in antiviral cellular defence and inflammation.

In addition to aging, the inability to form new memories is associated with serious medical conditions including Alzheimer's Disease and diabetes. Common to these conditions is the inability to consolidate memories. Memories are intact for a short while (30 minutes) after the event to be remembered, but memory does not pass on into permanent storage. We have been able to achieve memory consolidation in a particular learning task, which is not normally remembered, by injection of drugs acting on novel receptors (beta 3 adrenoceptors) in the brain of day old chicks. These drugs mimic the action of noradrenaline at beta-3 adrenoceptors. There are a number of ways in which memory consolidation can be enhanced, and we will compare the effects of beta-3 drugs with other potential drugs acting at other types of noradrenaline receptors. One of the actions of beta-3 agonists is related to the uptake of glucose into cells in the brain. We will investigate whether the mechanism of beta-3 enhancement of memory involves the uptake of glucose in brain tissue and studies in cultures of individual cell types will show us which cells are involved. Although this work is done using young chicks, there is no reason to suppose that the basic memory mechanisms at the level of the nerve cell should be different in birds or mammals. There are distinct advantages to using chicks in this research as they can form a long lasting memory for an experience lasting only 10 seconds, and they will discriminate between different colours as part of their learning. This research is aimed at understanding the processes involved in and influencing memory formation. If we are going to develop drugs to alleviate the cognitive problems of old age and more serious cognitive diseases, we need to understand more about the basic mechanisms of memory formation in the normal animal.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Dr Marie Gibbs", "Prof Roger Summers"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 241018.36, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2001, "endDate": 2003, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-11T08:25:33Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T14:47:22Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Dr Marie Gibbs"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143664", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143664", "143664"], "subjects": ["Medical microbiology not elsewhere classified", "Medical microbiology", "BIOMEDICAL AND CLINICAL SCIENCES", "distribution of beta 3 adrenoceptors in the brain", "glucose uptake and memory formation", "involvement of noradrenaline in memory", "memory consolidation", "molecular pharmacology of beta-3 adrenoceptors", "Alzheimer's disease", "aging", "diabetes", "diseases with cognitive deficits", "memory disorders"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/82039"}]}, {"id": "81052", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143678", "type": "grant", "title": "Investigation of shear-sensitive signalling pathways in human platelets", "description": "Platelets are extremely important cells that control bleeding by sticking to injured blood vessels to form a blood clot.

Platelets stick to the wall of a blood vessel when receptors on the surface of these cells interact with materials (ligands) that are exposed when the vessel wall is injured. The stickiness or adhesive behaviour of platelets is controlled by many proteins (enzymes) which are contained inside these cells. These enzymes transmit messages from platelet receptors on the surface into the cell interior, thereby controlling platelet behaviour. We are in the process of identifying several types of enzymes which are responsible for controlling platelet stickiness.

Although some of the burden of cardiovascular diseases may be reduced by effective public health measures (e.g., to reduce saturated fat intake), hypertension remains largely impervious to preventative public health measures. While treatment of established high blood pressure can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease, preventing the development of hypertension in the first place is not possible at this time. A major impediment to the development of effective public health measure is our lack of knowledge of the pathological mechanisms involved, despite over 100 years of active research effort. The experiments planned in this study will probe below the surface of two important facts known about hypertension but not previously brought together - that the kidney's blood vessels and nerves are remodeled in hypertension, and that the kidney's control of the level of blood pressure must be changed in order for high blood pressure to develop in the first place.

However some recent overseas studies have suggested that tiny particles less than 0.1 thousandths of a millimetre might have the greatest effects on the heart and lungs. We will conduct the first Australian study of the health effects of these tiny particles. Particle counts will be measured in Melbourne by CSIRO using state of the art equipment. Two groups of older subjects will be recruited: patients with chronic lung diseases such as emphysema and patients with heart disease. They will perform regular breathing tests and-or have the electrical activity of their hearts recorded. The recordings will be analysed to detect small variations in heart rate. If we find relationships between particle counts and lung function or heart rate variability, this will provide new evidence of the health effects of air pollution. When the NEPMs are revised, new measures may be required for tiny particles.

The internal surface of the alveoli are lined with 2 types of specialist cells, the type-I and type-II cells. Both cells are essential for the normal functioning of the lung; type-I cells provide a thin barrier for the gas exchange, whereas type-II cells produce the surface-active material, surfactant. In order to survive after birth, the lungs of the newborn must have appropriate numbers of each of these cell types. However, babies that are born very prematurely have few, if any, mature cells as most are non-specialised cells that possess none of the characteristics of mature type-I and type-II cells. Therefore, the lungs of very preterm babies have low levels of surfactant, are prone to injury and infection and are not efficient in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. As such, these infants are at high risk of developing chronic lung disease which is a serious debilitating disease that has long term health implications. We believe that the non-specialised cells are more prone to injury and cell death than mature cells which makes the very premature infant more susceptible to the development of chronic lung disease. As the survival and respiratory health of these infants depends upon most type-I and type-II cells maturing after birth, it is critical to understand the factors that regulate their maturation. This information will allow the development of treatments that can enhance the maturation of these cell types. This application is focused towards understanding the factors that control maturation of type-I and type-II cells, as well as the role of the non-specialised cells in the development of chronic lung disease in babies that are born very prematurely.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["A/Pr Timothy Cole", "Dr Megan Wallace", "Prof Stuart Hooper"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 484500, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2005, "endDate": 2007, "dateTimeModified": "2015-05-06T16:03:23Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T13:42:21Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Stuart Hooper"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334161", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334161", "334161"], "subjects": ["Foetal Development and Medicine", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "PAEDIATRICS AND REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE", "alveolar epithelial cells", "corticosteroids", "fetal and postnatal lung development", "lung injury", "premature birth", "cell growth / differentiation", "infant, premature", "lung development", "respiratory insufficiency in the newborn"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/76424"}]}, {"id": "117066", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/977713", "type": "grant", "title": "Renal antihypertensive mechanisms", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Prof Roger Evans"], "description": null, "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 304123.75, "fundingScheme": "Career Development Fellowships", "startDate": 1997, "endDate": 2000, "dateTimeModified": "2015-05-06T16:17:50Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T17:32:58Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Roger Evans"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/977713", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/977713", "977713"], "subjects": ["MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "PRESSURE NATRIURESIS", "MEDULLIPIN", "RENAL MEDULLA", "BLOOD FLOW", "SYMPATHETIC NERVES"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/117066"}]}, {"id": "98240", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/400937", "type": "grant", "title": "A randomised controlled trial of exercise programs for preventing knee injuries", "description": "The promotion of physical activity, either through organised sport or active recreation, is a key public health strategy in this country. However, there is a risk of injury during this participation and efforts need to be undertaken to reduce this risk so that spor is safe for all. Sports injury prevention efforts to date in Australia have been severely hampered by a lack of evidence supporting currently advocated countermeasures. This concern has been recognised by both the NHMRC and the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing. It is imperative that we formally evaluate the effectiveness of sports injury countermeasures in the context of broad community level participation in sport, in contrast to previous research focussed on professional sport, and begin to deliver the preventive measures to the community. Australian football is a popular sport throughout Australia and it is associated with more medically-treated injuries than any other sport. Knee injuries are particularly common and can have severe consequences. One of the most commonly recommended knee injury prevention strategies is a well-designed exercise training program. Despite their potential to significantly reduce injury rates, the effectiveness of exercise training programs to prevent knee injuries in football, and indeed in most other sports, has not previously been assessed but has been identified as a priority research area by the NHMRC.

Unfortunately this benefit is not sustained and is frequently marred by the production of unpleasant writhing wriggling movements called dyskinesia. These movements can also complicate the treatment for schizophrenia and other neurological conditions. The way the brain compensates for loss of SN neurones and why dyskinesia occur is unknown.

We have shown that an injury to the SN results in a compensatory response of vigorous sprouting of the surviving dopamine neurones. This sprouting may also explain why dyskinesias occur.

Accordingly, it also imposes a significant cost burden to the community. The key to effective prevention is understanding of the roles of risk factors in the development of heart disease. These are best defined through the use of large cohort studies, which are those that follow up a group of individuals over time. Statistical analyses are used to develop prediction equations to quantify the effects of multiple risk factors in terms of their contributions to risk of heart disease. The current heart disease prediction equations most commonly used in Australia are based on older overseas studies, such as the Framingham Heart Study. Other than having low relevance to the current Australian population, they incorporate only a limited range of traditional risk factors. A spectrum of new risk factors is emerging. This study aims to develop risk prediction equations for heart disease that are applicable to the current Australian population, using contemporary data from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study. Results from this study will allow the future onset of heart disease to be predicted with accuracy and confidence, which in turn will allow preventive strategies, including expensive drugs, to be utilised in a more effective manner. Ultimately, the results will lead to a more efficient allocation of limited healthcare resources in Australia.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["A/Pr Dianna Magliano", "Prof Danny Liew", "Prof John Mcneil", "Prof Stephen Harrap", "Prof Timothy Welborn"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 427500, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2005, "endDate": 2009, "dateTimeModified": "2015-05-06T15:37:27Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T15:56:54Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof John Mcneil"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334032", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/334032", "334032"], "subjects": ["Cardiology (incl.

Shift workers working outside the 8am-5pm day, make up about 20% of the urban working population. These individuals often report excessive daytime sleepiness caused by irregular sleep-wake patterns and long-term sleep loss. Excessive sleepiness is also common in individuals with sleep disorders. While there are many stimulant and wake-promoting drugs available to counteract daytime fatigue such drugs have problems of side effects, interactions and in some cases dependence. Light has many beneficial effects for a wide range of medicinal, physiological, psychological, and social purposes. One well known effect is as a stimulant so that exposure to bright light, both during the night and in the middle of the day, improves alertness and attention, and decreases reaction times thus improving performance. These effects can also be measured as changes in brain activity. However we do not understand the mechanisms in the eyes which control these effects. While certain cells in the eyes called rods and cones are necessary for seeing objects clearly and for detecting colour, there appears to be another system in the eyes which may involve different specialized cells or photoreceptors that are important for the alerting effects of light. White light is made up of different wavelengths or colours of light. This study will examine which wavelength (blue, violet, red or green) of light best improves alertness and learning during the daytime. Various performance tests will be used in addition to measures of brain wave activity. By identifying the most effective wavelength of light for improving alertness in healthy young adults and better understanding the mechanisms in the eyes involved, we will be able to develop light treatment strategies in patient groups with sleep disorders and in individuals like shift workers who experience sleep loss.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Jennifer Redman", "Prof Shanthakumar Wilson Rajaratnam", "Prof Steven Lockley"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 446367.16, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2007, "endDate": 2009, "dateTimeModified": "2015-05-06T16:10:27Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T13:43:21Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Shanthakumar Wilson Rajaratnam"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436758", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436758", "436758"], "subjects": ["PSYCHOLOGY", "PSYCHOLOGY AND COGNITIVE SCIENCES", "EEG", "circadian rhythm", "light sensitivity", "melatonin", "spectrophotometry", "behaviour", "cognition", "photobiology", "sleep deprivation", "sleepiness"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/78261"}]}, {"id": "947563", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1125376", "type": "grant", "title": "A novel role for proteolysis in promoting inner ear cell injury and hearing loss", "description": "Nearly 40% of hearing loss is attributable to traumatic noise exposure.

With increasing population levels of overweight, governments are increasingly advocating public health measures aimed at increasing physical activity levels or otherwise decreasing weight. There has been much research concerning which of these factors is the key prognostic factor for adverse health outcomes, but an ongoing lack of clarity of research findings has led to uncertainty as to the direction of recommendations for preventive health strategies and population lifestyle changes. In addition, the risks of overweight, in particular, have been accused of being exaggerated in both the scientific and lay literature. This is often due to the difficulty of dealing appropriately with time varying confounders which are also intermediate factors (such as hypertension). To date, no studies have performed careful longitudinal modelling of the joint effects of physical inactivity and overweight on cardiovascular events and diabetes while taking into account the effects of factors, such as hypertension or atherosclerosis, that influence both physical activity and overweight as well as disease, and simultaneously are consequences of these risk factors. Standard statistical methods are known to produce biased estimates in these situations but we will apply more recently developed statistical techniques to provide much improved estimation of these effects. After the statistical modelling stage, we will model the burden of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and mortality associated with given levels of overweight and physical inactivity.

At the first level of analysis, the primary visual cortex (V1), individual cells become active only if line segments or borders of a particular orientation are present in their field of detection, which encompasses a small part of the visual scene. Cells in other visual cortical areas (the extrastriate cortex) perform more complex detection tasks in comparison with those in V1, which demand integration of information coming from much larger portions of the visual scene. One example of these more complex properties is the phenomenon of long-range contour integration, where our visual system groups individual line segments having similar orientations, so that they are perceived as part of the same contour. This property is reflected in the electrical responses of cells in the dorsomedial visual area (DM). How are properties such as orientation specificity and long-range contour integration created? To begin addressing this question, we will investigate correlations between the physiological properties of identified cells, the spatial distribution of their information collecting regions (dendrites), and the anatomical pathways by which they receive information from other parts of the brain. This is a basic science study aimed at determining the extent to which the anatomical structure of the brain helps define the function of individual cells and brain areas. Its primary benefit will be to increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying all sensory processing in the brain.

It is characterised by severe inflammation and destruction of joints resulting in significant health problems. The lining tissue of joints is known to be infiltrated by inflammatory cells. In addition to this infiltration of inflammatory cells, there is overgrowth of the normal lining cells of joints. These overgrowing cells contribute significantly to joint damage by invading cartilage and bone and allowing inflammatory cells to reach these areas. The abnormal growth of these cells has been related to the malfunction of certain genes that usually restrain abnormal growth. These genes called tumour suppressor genes are known to be damaged in joint lining cells derived from RA. The best known of these abnormal tumour suppressor genes is called p 53. The product of the p53 gene, the p 53 protein, is particularly important in slowing down the growth of cells. The applicant has recently shown that an inflammatory product called MIF is released in large quantities by joint lining cells in RA. Previous studies by the applicant have shown that blocking MIF using an antibody almost completely prevents arthritis development in a rat model. These studies indicate that MIF is likely to be an important contributor to disease in RA. Recent preliminary studies in the applicant s laboratory have shown that MIF can decrease p53 levels in joint lining cells from RA patients and also that MIF can increase the growth rate of these cells. These preliminary data indicate that MIF may contribute significantly to disease in RA by overriding control of normal cell growth by p53. Confirmation and full exploration of the regulation of p53 expression and function by MIF may highlight a novel way to treat the excessive growth and invasion by joint lining cells which characterises RA.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Prof Michelle Leech"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 333055.1, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2001, "endDate": 2003, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-11T08:28:13Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T15:17:50Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Michelle Leech"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143707", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143707", "143707"], "subjects": ["321028", "cytokine", "fibroblast-like synoviocytes", "macrophage migration inhibitory factor", "p53", "proliferation", "arthritis,rheumatoid", "drug therapy", "synovium"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/86722"}]}, {"id": "455342", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1068406", "type": "grant", "title": "New Treatments for Acute Kidney Injury-Targeting the IL-17A pathway", "description": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common cause of ill-health and death.

WHO projections suggest that by 2020 the burden of depression alone will be second only to cardiovascular disease. New treatments for mental disorders are being developed which must be evaluated. Current research methods do not allow an accurate comparison of the cost effectiveness of these therapies with the cost effectiveness of other medical services as this requires the measurement of 'utility' or 'quality of life'. The small number of 'generic' 'quality of life instruments' developed to date vary significantly in their 'sensitivity' to different illnesses-their ability to detect change-and none is very sensitive to changes in mental health states. The present project is to overcome this deficit. This will be achieved by refining and expanding an instrument developed in Australia, the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL) instrument. This is the only instrument to date which was both constructed using correct psychometric principles of instrument construction and which describes health states in terms of the effect upon a patient's ability to function in a social environment. The new instrument called the PsyQoL will increase instrument sensitivity by including a mental health 'module' to the existing instrument and revising existing items. The methods used will include several methodological innovations in the description of health states and the derivation of utility scores. The project will include a large scale 'validation' study which will include the construction of population 'norms' and also the creation of 'exchange rates' between the PsyQoL and other instrument scores. The significance of the project is that the PsyQoL will allow valid and reliable measurement of health states in a way that creates a 'level playing field' between mental and other health related interventions.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["A/Pr Cathrine Mihalopoulos", "A/Pr Graeme Hawthorne", "Prof Helen Herrman", "Prof Jeff Richardson", "Stuart Peacock"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 539450, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2004, "endDate": 2006, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-11T08:39:00Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T16:56:29Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Jeff Richardson"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284283", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284283", "284283"], "subjects": ["Inorganic green chemistry", "Inorganic chemistry", "CHEMICAL SCIENCES", "economic evaluation in mental health", "health related quality of life assessment", "instrument development for HRQoL in mental health", "quality of life assessment in mental health", "anxiety disorders", "depression", "post traumatic stress disorder", "psychotic disorders", "substance abuse disorders"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/99734"}]}, {"id": "109552", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1011136", "type": "grant", "title": "Why is the kidney vulnerable to preterm birth?", "description": "We have shown that premature birth leads to abnormalities in kidney structure and function.

Such diseases kill over a million people, mainly infants in developing countries, every year and lead to serious morbidity and mortality even in industrialised countries with well developed health care systems. In many cases the virulence of Shigella species is augmented by large fragments of DNA, called pathogenicity islands, that carry genes which contribute to the development of disease (pathogenesis) in humans. Pathogenicity islands are important genetic elements which appear to spread independantly throughout bacterial populations and therefore contribute to the emergence of new virulence traits in bacteria. Recently, we identified two related pathogenicity islands carried by both Shigella flexneri and other species of the genus Shigella. The two pathogenicity islands belong to a unique class of genetic elements found in Shigella species and virulent strains of the intestinal bacterium E. coli. Our current study is aimed at (1) understanding the mechanisms by which one of these islands, the she pathogenicity island, spreads from one bacterial strain to another to introduce disease-producing or virulence genes to new bacteria and (2) to study how the sigA virulence gene, carried on the she pathogenicity island, contributes to disease development in humans. We know that sigA encodes a protein toxin which contributes to the loss of fluid from the intestines of rabbits that have been experimentally infected with Shigella flexneri. We propose to study the structure and function of the SigA protein to determine how it interacts with tissues to produce a pathological state. Such studies will enhance our understanding of the process of disease development and contribute to the investigation and assessment of new strategies for therapeutic intervention.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Dr Harry Sakellaris", "Prof Ben Adler", "Prof Martin Scanlon"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 110625, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2003, "endDate": 2003, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-11T08:35:16Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T16:45:43Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Ben Adler"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236809", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/236809", "236809"], "subjects": ["Allergy", "Immunology", "BIOMEDICAL AND CLINICAL SCIENCES", "autotransporter", "bacillary dysentery", "molecular pathogenesis", "pathogenicity island", "dysentery", "infectious diseases", "mechanisms of pathogenesis"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/98042"}]}, {"id": "101378", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/910691", "type": "grant", "title": "Preservation of eggs by freezing", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Prof Alan O Trounson"], "description": null, "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 43248.7, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 1991, "endDate": 1991, "dateTimeModified": "2015-05-06T16:01:53Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T16:57:50Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/910691", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/910691", "910691"], "subjects": ["cell structure", "cell viability", "oocyte maturation", "oocytes", "cryopreservation", "Clinical Medicine and Science", "Reproduction", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "PAEDIATRICS AND REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/101378"}]}, {"id": "96114", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/384126", "type": "grant", "title": "Regulation of platelet adhesion by the GPIbalpha cytoplasmic tail", "description": "Platelets are small blood cells that play an essential role in the normal blood clotting process that stops bleeding following an injury to a blood vessel.

When platelets stick to sites of blood vessel injury they must respond very rapidly to ensure the formation of a stable blood clot.

In this project we will examine these operations in neurons in the cortex that receive input from the large face whiskers of the rat. These whiskers are used for fine-grain discrimination and for gauging distance. They are deflected by being actively moved, under muscle control, over objects (active touch) or by being passively deflected by objects. Deflection results in inputs to the brain that are processed to form the neural basis for very finely detailed perceptual behaviour. In rats, with impoverished visual and auditory senses, the whiskers are the major sensory system for interacting with the world, and are used in navigating the environment and in finding and distinguishing foods. Thus they contribute strongly to the remarkable success of this species. This elegant sensory system has a number of advantages that make it a very good model for the study of brain mechanisms responsible for active fine-grain sensory function. We plan to take advantage of the unique features of this system to define the information processing that occurs in the cortex in this elegantly complex system. This will address an issue relevant to all sensory systems - namely the neural basis of complex fine grain perceptual behaviour. Understanding the mechanisms underlying active tactile perception also has relevance to clinical conditions involving deficits in active touch e.g., in diabetic polyneuropathy (which eventually affects ~50% of diabetics), in leprosy (in which an early sign is damage to active touch).

In the adult, CREATINE is obtained either from the diet (after absorption from the gut), or after synthesis in, and release from the liver. We do not know how fetal tissues obtain CREATINE, but we do know that when CREATINE is too low the fetus is likely to die, and that if extra CREATINE is supplied in the mother's diet the fetus is more likely to survive profound asphyxia at birth. In this project, in pregnant animals we will determine if fetal tissues can synthesize and take up CREATINE, and if providing extra CREATINE in the maternal diet throughout pregnancy can protect the heart, brain and breathing apparatus from the damaging effects of asphyxia or low oxygen (hypoxia).

Despite this, relatively little is known about the processes of sperm production and fertilization. As such, there is an urgent need for futher research if we are to hope to develop diagnostics, targeted therapeutics and to take advantage of the growing awareness by pharmaceutical companies of the market for male gamete based contraceptives. The cysteine rich secretory proteins (Crisps) are a group of proteins which show a remarkable bias to the male reproductive tract. All four are incorporated into sperm. Recently published data from us indicates that they have the ability to regulated calcium flow in sperm and as such sperm activity. The aim of the current proposal is to explore the biological relevance of one domain of Crisp proteins using animal models, in vitro sperm tests and through an analysis of ion flux and phosphorylation status under conditions of altered Crisp-1 and -2 content. The data generated from this project will make a significant contribution to the development of novel male gamete based contraceptives for use by either men or women. In addition, through the attainment of a greater understanding of sperm development and function, we will be able to more precisely define types of infertility, thus allowing for the development of more targeted therapies.

Changes in behaviour such as increasing physical activity and eating less high-calorie food help many people reduce their body weight, however many others have a genetic predisposition to become overweight and behavioural measures are ineffective. Although anti-obesity drugs should be a valuable adjunct to lifestyle changes, the currently available appetite suppressants are not ideal. Our work involves studying particular cell-surface proteins (receptors) which normally respond to hormones such as adrenaline. The beta(3)-adrenergic receptor is known to mediate the breakdown of fats and increased heat production in adipose tissue and possibly muscle. Administration of beta(3)-selective drugs to obese mice promotes weight loss and a reduction of diabetic symptoms, and a number of drugs targetting the human beta(3)-adrenergic receptor are being developed by pharmaceutical companies. We are trying to understand more about the properties of this receptor, as this information will assist in designing drugs which are more selective and more potent. Sometimes drugs act at more than one receptor, and there is evidence that this may be the case for two drugs called CGP 12177 and BRL 37344 which stimulate the beta(3)-adrenergic receptor. The second major aim of our project is to find out whether these drugs act at a novel receptor which is related to the beta(3)-adrenergic receptor and also mediates energy expenditure and heat production in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle.

The primary treatment for episodes of acute thrombosis is administration of the anticoagulant, heparin. The effector molecule through which heparin carries out its action is the serine proteinase inhibitor, antithrombin. This molecule regulates blood clotting by inhibiting the proteinases which carry out this process. Antithrombin is converted from a poor inhibitor of coagulation proteases to a very good inhibitor on binding heparin. This provides a control point for coagulation. The mechanism by which antithrombin is converted to a very good inhibitor of coagulation proteases involves a large change in the structure of this protein. These changes in structure are linked to the changes which occur when antithrombin becomes inactive through the process of polymerisation. Certain patients with thrombosis have been found to have changes in both the stability and heparin affinity of their antithrombin molecules, which forms the underlying basis for the disease. We wish to study the reasons for the effects of mutations in the antithrombin variants by making recombinant mutants which mimic the molecules in the thrombotic patients and carrying out detailed, sophisticated molecular analyses of their interaction with heparin and proteases and their stability under various conditions. Additionally we will engineer recombinant mutants of antithrombin which we believe will stabilise the molecule and potentially act as an improved supplement for therapy.

The importance of OA has been acknowledged by its listing within musculoskeletal disease, the 7th health priority in Australia. It is 4 times as common in women as in men.Treatments which slow or prevent OA progressing are limited, so prevention must play a key role. With increasing disease severity, joint cartilage is lost. We have recently developed a method to measure joint cartilage from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans which is able to assess the severity of structural changes in the knee. Using this method will allow us to assess 2 issues: 1) Obesity is the only identified modifiable risk factor for knee OA. However, the mechanism is poorly understood. Weight loss programs may be more effective at reducing the risk of OA if they are combined with programs aimed at maintaining muscle mass. 2) Bone is important in development of Knee OA, but its role is poorly understood. Understanding how bone metabolism relates to risk of knee OA may allow us to prevent disease. Bone is more likely to respond to pharmacological manipulation than cartilage. Thus it may prove a more effective target for intervention than cartilage. The Geelong Osteoporosis Study was begun in 1994 to study bone health in Australian women (urban and rural). Much information relevant to the risk of OA has been collected over the past decade. By performing MRI of the knee now and in 2 years time, we will determine the effect of different measures of obesity and bone metabolism on structural change at the knee which predisposes to OA. Since both of these factors (obesity and bone metabolism) are potentially modifiable, this study may offer new avenues of prevention and therapy in knee OA. This has the potential to promote a better quality of life as people age and to reduce the economic burden of knee OA in the community.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["A/Pr Anita Wluka", "A/Pr Margaret Henry", "Prof Julie Pasco", "Prof Mark Kotowicz"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 199176.19, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2007, "endDate": 2009, "dateTimeModified": "2015-05-06T15:36:39Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T15:56:31Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["A/Pr Anita Wluka"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436665", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436665", "436665"], "subjects": ["Rheumatology and Arthritis", "MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "CLINICAL SCIENCES", "body composition", "bone", "cartilage", "osteoarthritis", "risk factors", "bone resorption", "cartilage/bone disorder", "longitudinal", "osteoarthritis- knee"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/95115"}]}, {"id": "1348962", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/GNT1150989", "type": "grant", "title": "An exploration of the nature and meaning of informal communities in cancer treatment", "description": "The interactions that occur in cancer treatment with other patients, family members and staff are often unavoidable.

ACE inhibitors have been highly successful in the management of hypertension, are standard therapy following myocardial infarction to delay the development of heart failure, and also reduce the rate of progression of renal disease. Recently, a novel enzyme called ACE2 has been discovered in the heart and kidneys. Unlike ACE, ACE2 causes the formation of the vasodilator, Ang 1-7. We have data in the heart and the kidney that supports the concept that ACE2 acts in a counter-regulatory manner to ACE. We suggest that ACE2 may play an important role to modulate the balance between vasoconstrictors and vasodilators in the heart and kidney. The studies detailed in this proposal are designed to specifically examine the role and regulation of ACE2 in the healthy heart and kidney as well as in cardiovascular and renal disease. The project brings together two groups with complementary skills and techniques, both of whom have collaborations with the discoverers of ACE2, and who have been exploring the role of ACE2 as evidenced from our recent publication (Tikellis et al, Hypertension in press, 2003).", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Prof Alexander Smith", "Prof Colin Johnston", "Prof

In this project we propose that hypoxic (low oxygen) conditions in the womb, either alone or in combination with substances released because of maternal infection, cause accumulation of a neurotoxic substance - QUINOLINIC ACID - in the fetal brain and circulation. The increased production of QUINOLINIC ACID occurs because certain cells react to the low oxygen and infectious conditions - these cells include MICROGLIA, a cell type in the brain. Little is currently known about MICROGLIA in the developing brain. We will therefore study the effects of hypoxia and infection in fetal sheep, and we will determine how these conditions affect MICROGLIA and the synthesis of QUINOLINIC ACID in the fetal brain. The capacity of the brain to produce QUINOLINIC ACID is closely related to the dietary intake of the essential amino acid TRYPTOPHAN, and it is decreased when synthetic analogues of tryptophan are infused. Therefore, we have devised a treatment regime using these tryptophan analogues to prevent increases of QUINOLINIC ACID concnetrations in the fetal brain, and we propose that a simple treament is at hand to reduce the incidence of perinatal brain damage in human pregnancies.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": null, "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 92815.57, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2000, "endDate": 2000, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-11T08:32:27Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T15:57:36Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": null, "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/124344", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/124344", "124344"], "subjects": ["Medical infection agents (incl. prions)", "Medical microbiology", "BIOMEDICAL AND CLINICAL SCIENCES", "Asphyxia and excitotoxic brain damage", "Fetal hypoxia and birth trauma", "Kynurenines, kynurenic acid & quinolinic acid", "Perinatal brain damage", "Cerebral palsy", "Maternal infection", "Pregnancy complications and newborn health", "Preterm labor"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/96533"}]}, {"id": "97093", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/980868", "type": "grant", "title": "Cardiac efficiency: effects of substrate, work pattern, and ischemia", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Colin Gibbs"], "description": null, "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 152507.67, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 1998, "endDate": 2000, "dateTimeModified": "2015-05-06T15:43:46Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T16:44:52Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Colin Gibbs"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/980868", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/980868", "980868"], "subjects": ["MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES", "CARDIAC EFFICIENCY", "SUBSTRATES", "AFTERLOAD", "ENERGETICS", "HUMAN EFFICIENCY"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/97093"}]}, {"id": "100576", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/606407", "type": "grant", "title": "Regulation of subcellular localisation of respiratory syncytial virus M protein: implications for pathology", "description": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of viral pneumonia in infants and the elderly, causing more deaths in winter than influenza.

The genes involved in FS contribute to the extracellular matrix which is effectively the scaffolding which our cells use when developing into our organs. The extracellular matrix is also important in maintaining our adult tissues and responding to damage. It can act as a physical support and as a key controller of how ours cells react to growth factors and to each other. This proposal will explore how the Fras and Frem genes mediate these interactions to control normal development and also to determine how their mutation gives rise to disease. In doing so we hope to gain insights into more common diseases which affect both the kidney and the skin.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["A/Pr Ian Smyth"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 475517.16, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2007, "endDate": 2009, "dateTimeModified": "2015-05-06T15:53:47Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T16:56:06Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["A/Pr Ian Smyth"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436659", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/436659", "436659"], "subjects": ["Developmental Genetics (incl.

This affects our abilities at many ordinary tasks, such as keeping up a conversation in a noisy background, and also in other critical tasks (eg., in following warning signals in a noisy factory environment). In people who have some hearing loss, even if only partial deafness, localization ability is disrupted even when there is no noise in the background, and is even more severely disrupted when the environment is noisy. SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND : Our localization ability depends on the way neurons in the brain code the position of a source of sound we wish to detect. From studies in animals we know a lot about the way in which neurons do this coding in silence. However, we know almost nothing about how this coding is affected by a noisy background. Further, we know absolutely nothing about how this coding, whether in silence or when there is noise, is affected when there is also a hearing loss. SIGNIFICANCE : If we are to understand the effects of hearing losses on coding of the location of a sound signal we need to know first how noise affects the coding in cases of normal hearing. This project aims to gain that information. I will then extend this to studying the detailed basis of these effects, ie., exactly what mechanisms are affected in the neurons. Then I will determine how noise from different positions affects the coding of signal sounds at differnt positions. These data will provide us the essential base from which we can, later, go on to study how noise affects coding by neurons of the location of a signal. I plan to increase the value of the current study by developing, from the data gained in the studies in animals, computer-based models that will allow us to predict how coding of sound signal location is affected by hearing loss, and how this is exacerbated by noisy environments.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Prof Ramesh Rajan"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 180160.06, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2000, "endDate": 2002, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-11T08:39:09Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T16:56:44Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Ramesh Rajan"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/124324", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/124324", "124324"], "subjects": ["Medical infection agents (incl. prions)", "Medical microbiology", "BIOMEDICAL AND CLINICAL SCIENCES", "Auditory system", "Background Noise", "Neural mechanisms", "Sound localization", "Aging", "Central nervous system function", "Hearing Losses"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/100057"}]}, {"id": "518875", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1082401", "type": "grant", "title": "Host-pathogen interactions in clostridial myonecrosis", "description": "This project will show how the bacteria that cause gas gangrene interact with host cells in an infection.

A central intracellular signaling enzyme that initiates lipid messages that promote glucose uptake into the cell and promote cell survival is that generated by the PI3-kinase. This enzyme has increased activity in many cancers, and is also important in diabetes when the enzyme may be suppressed. Our grant proposes to investigate the function of another enzyme called SKIP which acts within the cell to oppose the functions of the PI3-kinase. Several lines of evidence indicate SKIP may be important in both development and cancer. SKIP has been identified as a putative candidate gene for a developmental disorder known as Miller Dieker syndrome. This disease is associated with facial and significant brain abnormalities. In addition the SKIP gene is located on a chromosome that is frequently deleted in breast and colon cancer. SKIP is an enzyme that functions to remove phosphate molecules from PI3-kinase signaling molecules. SKIP has been shown to prevent glucose uptake into the cell by breaking down PI3-kinase signals. We have recently demonstrated SKIP phosphatase activity can be inhibited by binding to another protein called suppressor of death domains (SODD).

These virulence determinants are either directly involved in allowing infection to take place, or cause the damage that we recognize as an infectious disease. Some virulence determinants are produced all the time, while others are only made under particular conditions, that is, their expression is regulated. To target efforts in the development of new vaccines and treatments, it is important to identify all the virulence determinants produced by a particular bacterial species, but also to know which are regulated, and the environmental signals that determine their expression. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis are two important disease-causing bacteria that exclusively infect humans and cause gonorrhoea, and meningitis. The complete DNA sequence of both of these bacteria is now known. From computer analysis of these data, it appears that these bacteria have few of the specific regulatory systems that are present in other bacteria. Because of the limited repertoire of regulatory systems still present in N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis, it is feasible to mutate each one and determine which are involved in regulation of virulence determinants. We have made copies of every individual gene found in the DNA sequence of these bacteria and have attached each one individually to a glass slide to form a microarray measuring 18mm x 18mm. This microarray will allow us to monitor the expression of every gene in these bacteria in response to environmental signals. This information will be used to identify all the virulence genes controlled by each regulatory system.

However, their molecular mechanisms are not entirely clear and some therapeutic options have not been utilized to their full potential. The hormone angiotensin II causes both excitatory and inhibitory cardiovascular effects via distinct binding sites. Of particular importance to contemporary society is the shift in the demographic to a more aged population. In Australia in 2002, 13% of the population (~2.5 million) were aged 65 years or over, and it has been estimated that this number will increase to 18% (~4 million) by the year 2021. While lipid status and smoking are well known risk factors for cardiovascular disease, advanced age by far confers the greatest risk for cardiovascular disease. In this context, we have found a greater role of the inhibitory angiotensin II binding site in aging that may result from breakdown products of angiotensin II having their own unique effects.

We have identified a new enzyme (72kDa 5-phosphatase) which resides inside the cell and regulates signals generated by an enzyme called PI3-kinase. Two of the PI3-kinase signals have been demonstrated to regulate the activity of an oncogene involved in breast and ovarian cancer. We aim to determine the specific role each of these PI3-kinase signals plays in the activation of the oncogene. In addition the levels of the 72kDa enzyme is altered in some cervical and lymphoma cancers. We will image live cells containing specific fluorescent probes under different conditions and study the activation and location of these probes in order to understand how different PI3-kinase signals are regulated in time and space. In addition to regulating signals that are involved in cancer, PI3-kinase controls signals that are important for proper immune function. Phagocytosis is a biological process where specialised immune cells (macrophages) take up and remove harmful particles such as bacteria or tumour cells from the circulation. This process depends on PI3-kinase and the signals it produces. We will determine whether the 72 kDa enzyme, which is expressed in macrophages, plays a role in regulating these signals during phagocytosis. We have shown that the 72 kDa enzyme can interact with several different proteins which may affect its location and activity within the cell.

Such impressions are particularly marked after eccentric exercise, during which the contracting muscles are forcibly lengthened. Activities such as walking downhill, skiing and horse riding involve eccentric exercise. The debilitating consequences of this kind of exercise are attributed, not just to the post-exercise effects of fatigue, but to loss of muscle force from damage to fibres. Eccentric exercise also leads to longer term effects. The breakdown of the damaged tissue leads to sensations of stiffness and soreness the next day. This application proposes experiments aimed at studying a number of effects of eccentric exercise on motor control, and establishing the muscle, spinal and brain levels at which they occur. Three studies are planned. In the first, the question will be explored whether we are less able to use the motor areas of our brains to execute voluntary contractions after exercise. So fatigue is not just a matter of exhausted muscles but perhaps also exhausted brains. We will use brain and spinal cord stimulation to explore this point. Then we plan to listen to single motor units, the basic elements of muscle control, to try to understand the mechanism by which the brain minimises the debilitating effects of fatigue. Finally we want to examine subjects' ability to locate their limbs in space as a means of providing a basis for the clumsiness we experience after intense exercise.

Since the late 1980s the use of lead compounds in Australia has decreased, but Australian and world lead production has increased. Australia is the world's biggest producer of lead. The precise number of lead workers worldwide is unknown but there are likely to be more than 2 million workers of which many are in developing countries where control of lead exposure is unsatisfactory and occupational exposure limits are considerably higher than in developed countries. Evidence for or against cancer risk with exposure to lead compounds , in particular inorganic lead, will therefore have implications for many Australian and international workers. This is also important for health risk assessment for environmental contamination in the Australian community. In our study we will review the state government archived records of about 8,000 lead workers in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, who took part in lead compound exposure surveys and had blood tests in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, as part of government lead regulations in force at the time.

Exactly what the members of the protein family do within cells remains to be established. However, by preparing cells which produce the ISG60 protein, we have found that it severely affects their growth, slowing the growth rate down and making the cells divide abnormally to become large, containing many nuclei and others dying. We propose that ISG60 binds to the structures involved in cell division and we have preliminary evidence that ISG60 interacts with an important protein involved in cell regulation, the retinoblastoma protein (pRb). The aim of this project is to more fully understand the role of ISG60 in cells. In particular, we aim to determine if ISG60 interacts with other important proteins inside cells. We shall explore the relationship of ISG60 function inside cells in greater detail as it should provide new insight into ways in which cell growth is regulated.

This project involves the study of the two bacteria that are the major causes of the disease. We aim to find out how the bacteria mediate the disease, in particular to determine which toxic factors produced by the bacteria are involved. The normal host response to a bacterial infection is a rapid influx of white blood cells to the infected tissue, which is part of the normal inflammatory response. These cells engulf and degrade the bacteria, clearing the infection. However, a major characteristic of gas gangrene pathology is that very few white blood cells infiltrate the infected tissue. We aim to determine why the host fails to mount an inflammatory response to this bacterial infection. We will achieve this objective by developing a better understanding of the role of the bacterial toxins in the development of this morbid disease.

Over the past 9 years our team has conducted a follow-up study of a large group of 111 Australian children and adolescents with autism. The young people have continued to have very high levels of emotional and behavioural disturbance and generally do not improve. Parents of children with autism are under significant amounts of stress; reporting high levels of disturbed family functioning and mental health problems. Although there is no cure, children benefit most when early help is provided (under 5 years). There are several promising interventions based on intensive behaviour and educational management, for example requiring 40 hours per week of therapist contact over 2 years. Such programs are costly and impractical as widely available treatment options. Training parents to understand and manage their child also shows promise. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a parent skills training and education treatment program compared to supportive therapy, and to generally available community services. The therapists will follow a treatment manual that will ensure a consistent and replicable approach. The progress of the children with autism and their families will be reassessed immediately after treatment, and at 1 and 2 years post-treatment in order to ascertain immediate and long-term effects of the treatment.

Alternative control measures are urgently needed and this project focuses on developing a better understanding of how the malaria parasite functions. If important processes such as red blood cell invasion can be understood in detail then it becomes possible to identify proteins essential for survival of the parasite. These could then be used as a vaccine against the disease. Current work suggests that the vaccine will be need more than one parasite protein and it becomes essential to identify the best combination of components. The parasite protein called MSP1 is thought to be a very promising candidate, but it is insufficiently active on its own. We have recently discovered a new protein in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, that is similar to MSP1. We would like to know more about this protein and determine if it may be a useful addition to MSP1 for a vaccine. This project intends to further characterize the properties of this new protein including its role in red blood cell invasion and to examine whether immunization with the rodent malaria form of the protein is able to protect mice against malaria infection.

The major problem suffered by very premature babies is lung immaturity and its associated harmful effects on brain development. Most very premature babies require resuscitation followed by ventilatory support,often for several weeks. This is extremely expensive and places an enormous financial burden on health care systems. Furthermore, it increases the risks of respiratory illnesses, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia and chronic lung disease which can impair breathing and increase susceptibility to respiratory disease such as asthma later in life. The overall aim of this program is to improve outcomes for very premature babies, including less lung injury, better respiratory health and shorter stays in hospitals. In order to reduce the health burden caused by very premature birth on the community we need to know more about how it alters the normal development of the lungs in the newborn period and into later life. In particular, we need to understand the cellular and molecular processes involved in lung development so that we can identify gene networks and developmental processes that are disrupted by severe premature birth. Such knowledge is necessary to provide a more rational, scientific basis for managing and treating the alterations in lung structure and function caused by premature birth. We also need to develop better ways of resuscitating and ventilating these infants so that lung injury is minimized.The research team is led by two neonatologists and three biomedical research scientists with a proven record of effective collaboration. This team is internationally unique in that it includes practicing neonatologists, respiratory physiologists and molecular biologists who have collaborated together productively and are regarded as world leaders in their respective fields. New talents have been brought into the team to provide expertise in pulmonary stem cell biology, the design of novel steroid drugs, and clinical follow-up. Together, this team has the potential (a) to greatly enhance the understanding of the impact of very premature birth on the developing lung, (b) to improve resuscitation and ventilation techniques, and (c) to translate the new knowledge into clinical practice to improve the outcome for prematurely born babies. Using well characterized animal models we will determine gene networks involved in fetal lung development and how these are altered by premature birth. The successful transition from fetal to postnatal life is critical for survival at birth but more information is needed. Using newborn lambs and rabbits, we will trial novel strategies for enhancing the transformation of the immaturelung into an effective gas exchange organ at birth.

It is also known that cardiovascular disease is a long-term consequence of untreated sleep disordered breathing in adults, however the long-term effects on the cardiovascular system in children are unknown. This study will examine both the neurocognitive and cardiovascular effects of a range of severities of sleep disordered breathing in children and will identify new more sensitive markers of sleep disruption in order to predict neurocognitive dysfunction.

It is the most common genetic cause of liver disease in children and the debilitating lung disease emphysema in adults. Antitrypsin is produced in the liver and secreted into the circulation. Its primary role is to inhibit the degradative enzyme elastase which attacks the tissues of the lung. A deficiency in Antitrypsin leads to uncontrolled elastase activity which destroys the lung tissue so causing emphysema. The deficiency is commonly caused by Antitrypsin being unable to enter the circulation. This is due to mutations within the Antitrypsin molecule which cause the protein to adopt an incorrect three-dimensional structure. This causes the protein to form long chains within the liver, which in turn damage the liver cell. There are no specific treatments for Antitrypsin deficiency, this partly reflects our lack of understanding of the molecular basis of the disease. This project examines the effects of the mutations upon the folding of Antitrypsin so that we can understand how these long protein chains form. Using a range of biochemical techniques we will monitor structural changes within the normal and abnormal proteins as they fold to determine how the mutations disrupt the process. These data will allow us to begin to rationally design inhibitors which will prevent the formation of the long chains, which we hope will aid in the treatment of patients with Antitrypsin deficiency. This increased understanding of Antitrypsin deficiency may also benefit other disease processes where similar protein misfolding occurs such as amyloid and prion diseases.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Prof Stephen Bottomley"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 255837.12, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2000, "endDate": 2002, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-11T08:26:12Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T14:47:33Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Stephen Bottomley"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/124493", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/124493", "124493"], "subjects": ["Oral and maxillofacial surgery", "Dentistry", "BIOMEDICAL AND CLINICAL SCIENCES", "fluorescence spectroscopy", "polymerisation", "protein folding", "proteinase inhibitor", "proteins", "Alpha-1-Antitrypsin deficiency", "Emphysema", "Inflammation", "Liver disease"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/82324"}]}, {"id": "1347728", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/GNT1128981", "type": "grant", "title": "Harnessing the type VI secretion system \u2018combat\u2019 arsenal of A. baumannii as a source of new antimicrobials and antimicrobial targets", "description": "Infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria represent one of the greatest threats to human health.

We have identified a new enzyme (72 kDa 5-phosphatase) which resides inside the cell, which we have evidence plays a role in regulating both the movement of intracellular vesicles and also lipid signals stimulated by insulin. We have characterised the phospholipids that the enzyme cleaves and demonstrated the generation of new cell signals at specific subcellular localizations on intracellular membranes. We predict the generation of these specific lipid signals may play a significant role in controlling the transport of intracellular cargo to specific sites in the cell. In this grant proposal we aim to examine the regulation of specialised cargo called the glucose transporter, which is found in fat and muscle cells, and also the mannose 6-phosphate receptor, which regulates the trafficking of specific enzymes which mediate digestion of proteins. These studies include the clarification of which phospholipid signals the enzyme terminates and where in the cell this occurs. Secondly, we will examine the movement of the glucose transporter GLUT-4 in unstimulated cells and in response to insulin and furthermore how expression of the novel enzyme regulates its movement. We will also examine the movement of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor and the specific phospholipid signals which control the route the receptor traffics, using inhibitors of lipid signals and expression of lipid phosphatases and kinases. We will also examine how our novel enzyme forms complexes with other molecules in the cell and characterise these novel molecules using basic biochemical assessment of enzyme activity and function.

We plan to examine neural control mechanisms that transform a primitive pattern of breathing in the early gestation fetus into the functional form that effectively ventilates the lungs after birth. In addition to examining the prenatal development of breathing, our program will focus on the developmental fate of a transient behaviour restricted to early development.

In one class of such receptors called G protein-coupled receptors, the transmission of the message to the interior of the cell involves yet another protein called G protein.

Our study is based on the hypothesis that growth control in human ES cells resembles growth control in the embryo, with interactions between stem cells and their differentiated offspring mediated by signals from membrane bound or soluble proteins directing the differentiation of the stem cells. We have recently identified several key protein regulators of human ES cells. This project will use high throughput analysis of gene expression to pinpoint more candidate regulatory proteins. Then we will use cell culture systems and techniques developed in our laboratory to determine how these proteins may act to control stem cell growth. These studies will result in a greatly improved ability to control stem cells and turn them into specialised cell types for use in research and regenerative medicine. These advances are essential if ES cells are to progress from their current status as an interesting laboratory phenomenon to become a powerful tool for research and medicine.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Prof Martin Pera"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 482640, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2002, "endDate": 2004, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-11T08:21:16Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T13:42:56Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Martin Pera"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194300", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194300", "194300"], "subjects": ["270106", "gene expression", "growth and differentiation", "human embryonic stem cells", "human germ cell tumour", "cancer", "drug discovery", "functional genomics", "regenerative medicine", "transplantation therapy"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/77633"}]}, {"id": "112547", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1056358", "type": "grant", "title": "TOLL LIKE RECEPTORS AGGRAVATE GLOMERULONEPHRITIS AND KIDNEY INJURY IN RENAL VASCULITIS", "description": "Anti neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitis (AAV) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.

The stiff painful shoulder affects up to 2-5% of the general population, being more common in middle age and diabetes. It causes significant pain and disability that restricts activities of daily living as well as work and leisure. Forty percent of sufferers will continue to have symptoms and restricted movements beyond 3 years and 15% will have persistent disability. Because this disease is prevalent, it imposes a considerable burden on the Australian health care system. Shoulder hydrodilatation is a common conservative treatment option that has been shown by our research group to have short-term but not long-term benefits. Physiotherapy may be prescribed following hydrodilatation on the basis that it may maintain the initial benefits seen with hydrodilatation. However, there are no studies to either support or refute this hypothesis. Thus, this novel research project will answer important questions about the efficacy of a physiotherapy program in addition to hydrodilatation for the stiff painful shoulder. We will determine whether physiotherapy offers a benefit over hydrodilatation alone and if so, whether this benefit is sustained. In addition we will determine whether the additional costs of physiotherapy represent good value for money. The results of this project can then be easily and immediately translated into clinical practice as recommendations can be made about the usefulness of physiotherapy for this patient population. The results will be of major benefit not just to the physiotherapy profession but to the medical profession who must justify patient referral to physiotherapy.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Prof Andrew Forbes", "Prof Anthony Harris", "Prof Kim Bennell", "Prof Rachelle Buchbinder", "Prof Sally Green"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 269020, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2002, "endDate": 2004, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-11T08:19:44Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T13:42:34Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Rachelle Buchbinder"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194417", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/194417", "194417"], "subjects": ["321024", "evidence based clinical practice", "physiotherapy", "randomised controlled trial", "shoulder disorders", "musculoskeletal disorders"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/76858"}]}, {"id": "96006", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/219177", "type": "grant", "title": "Sequence and genome analysis of Leptospira spp", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Prof Ben Adler", "Prof John Davies", "Prof Julian Rood", "Prof Ross Coppel"], "description": null, "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 2169000, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Strategic Awards", "startDate": 2001, "endDate": 2004, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-11T08:31:05Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T15:57:10Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Ben Adler"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/219177", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/219177", "219177"], "subjects": ["Allergy", "Immunology", "BIOMEDICAL AND CLINICAL SCIENCES", "Bacteriology", "Immunity", "Molecular Microbiology", "Pathogenesis", "Vaccines"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/96006"}]}, {"id": "110058", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1020694", "type": "grant", "title": "STandaRd Issue TrANsfusion versuS Fresher red blood cell Use in intenSive carE (TRANSFUSE) \u2013 a randomised controlled trial.", "description": "In Australia, blood for transfusions has a \u00e2\u0080\u009cuse by\u00e2\u0080\u009d date of 42 days after collection.

Knowledge of the process is largely based on studies using semi-intact cell systems, however, meaning that the role of cytoskeletal elements in nuclear transport has been largely overlooked. Intriguingly, in vivo studies, including our own relating to signalling molecules important in the regulation of cancer, clearly implicate the cellular microtubule (MT) network as playing an integral role in nuclear import. We propose to carry out a detailed examination of the mechanistic basis of the dependence of nuclear import on the MT network of 3 molecules regulating cancer. We will compare the properties of these molecules to those of other nuclear localizing molecules, as well as examine the ability to mediate nuclear import of similar MT-associating sequences from viral and other proteins. The results will establish for the first time, the generality of the dependence of nuclear protein import on cytoskeletal elements. Since the movement of large DNA molecules by simple diffusion is a limiting factor in non-viral gene delivery approaches, the possibility of applying this knowledge to facilitate the transport of DNA encoding therapeutic gene products to the nucleus of target cells, will also be assessed for the first time. We will use the modular sequences that confer interaction with the MT network to assist gene transfer by including them in modular constructs we have designed with this in mind. We will thus be able to test directly for the first time whether MT-interaction can enhance the delivery of DNA to the nucleus and reporter gene expression, with obvious application in gene therapy approaches.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Prof David Jans"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 491767.62, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2006, "endDate": 2008, "dateTimeModified": "2015-05-06T16:14:30Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T14:47:09Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof David Jans"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/384107", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/384107", "384107"], "subjects": ["060108 060111", "Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching", "Microtubule network", "Nuclear targeting signals/nuclear transport machinery", "Protein engineering", "Tumour suppressors", "Cancer", "Drug targeting", "Gene therapy", "Inborn errors of metabolism"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/81611"}]}, {"id": "111046", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1037092", "type": "grant", "title": "Molecular characterisation of host cell targets of human pathogenic viruses and evaluating their potential as novel therapeutic targets.", "description": "There are currently no therapeutics to treat victims of Hendra, Nipah or Rabies virus infections, which account for > 50,000 deaths/yr worldwide.

So, there is an urgent need to identify new, effective, and affordable ways of delivering cardiac rehabilitation programs to people after a heart attack. The proposed telephone-delivered program will be particularly appropriate for disadvantaged people, such as those living in rural and remote areas as well as Indigenous Australians, who do not currently have access to hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation programs. People who have had a heart attack will be recruited from three of Brisbane's largest public teaching hospitals, and will then be randomly assigned to the telephone-delivered cardiac rehabilitation program (Care Management Intervention group) or to a control or Usual Care group. The Care Management Intervention group will receive regular telephone calls from a highly qualified 'Care Manager' based at the renowned National Heart Foundation of Australia telephone support service, 'Heartline'. The Care Manager will help people to manage their heart condition and prevent the reoccurrence of further heart problems. People will also be encouraged to make necessary lifestyle and behavioural changes with the assistance of the Care Manager and some Heart Foundation educational and interactive resources to record their progress.

These steroids have major effects on the activity of the brain and influence behaviour in adult subjects. Changes in the production of steroids by the steroid producing glands influences neurosteroid levels in the adult brain. This in tern may cause behavioural and mood changes in adults, leading to conditions such as premenstrual stress and postnatal depression. In fetal life, the placenta releases large amounts of these neuroactive steroids and high concentrations of these steroid are found in the fetal circulation. We have shown that these steroids suppress the activity of the fetal brain, suppress arousal and maintain the fetus in a sleep-like state during pregnancy. In this proposal we investigate the hypothesis that cells in the fetal brain modify the neuroactive steroid environment within the brain so as to suppress fetal brain activity further during times of stress and, therefore, protect the brain from damage caused by excessive excitation. These mechanisms may prevent brain injury due to placental insufficiency during pregnancy and asphyxia during birth. The augmentation of these natural processes may form the bases for treatment strategies to provide additional protection for the fetal brain in high-risk pregnancies.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Jonathan Hirst"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 65685.6, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2000, "endDate": 2000, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-11T08:40:01Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T16:56:59Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Jonathan Hirst"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/124457", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/124457", "124457"], "subjects": ["Public health nutrition", "Nutrition and dietetics", "BIOMEDICAL AND CLINICAL SCIENCES", "Fetus", "GABAA receptor", "Neurosteroids", "Progesterone metabolism", "Steroidogenic enzymes", "Cerebral palsy", "Fetal development", "Neonatal seizures", "Sudden infant death syndrome"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/100407"}]}, {"id": "1347677", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/GNT1128267", "type": "grant", "title": "Cytokine Inhibition as a Potential Therapy for ANCA-Associated Glomerulonephritis", "description": "MPO-ANCA associated glomerulonephritis is a major cause of renal failure.

GAD in an essential human enzyme that is responsible for synthesising the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA functions in the human Central Nervous System (CNS) to dampen down excitatory signals. Proper control of GABA synthesis is important and perturbations in GABA levels lies behind human diseases such as intractable epilepsy, depression and schizophrenia. As a result of this role, numerous common therapeutics (for example benzodiazepines) target proteins involved in the GABA neurotransmitter system. The goal of this proposal is to use the molecular structures of GAD to understand how to achieve fine control of GABA production. In addition to its role in the CNS, GAD is an important human autoantigen. Antibodies to one isoform of GAD, GAD65, are found in most patients with type I diabetes as well as certain patients with the movement disorder stiff person syndrome and related diseases of the CNS. It is suggested that the development of auto-antibodies may play a key role in the pathophysiology of these conditions. Despite sharing >80% sequence similarity with GAD65, autoantibodies to the other isoform of GAD, GAD67, are rarely found in patients with disease. The aim of this grant is to characterise the region of GAD that is targetted by autoantibodes.

In addition, we intend to ascertain how different brain areas decrement in function over time and to determine whether there is a relationship between rate of disease progression, age at onset and certain genetic characteristics. Understanding how the brain functions and how the disease progresses over time will be essential, from the point of view of patient management, when new drug treatments eventually permit prevention of the development, or slows further progress, of the disorder.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["Dr Andrew Churchyard", "E/Pr John Bradshaw", "Prof Edmond Chiu", "Prof Gary Egan", "Prof Nellie Georgiou-Karistianis", "Prof Ross Cunnington"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 257550, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2004, "endDate": 2006, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-11T08:40:56Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T16:57:08Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Nellie Georgiou-Karistianis"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284247", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/284247", "284247"], "subjects": ["Economic history", "Applied economics", "ECONOMICS", "Cognition and Attention Deficits", "Experimental Neuropsychology", "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)", "Huntington's Disease", "Brain Imaging", "Movement Disorders", "Rate of Disease progression"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/100630"}]}, {"id": "112179", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1050817", "type": "grant", "title": "A newly identified role for 14-3-3zeta protein in thrombosis and platelet procoagulant activity", "description": "Cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and stroke is the major cause of death globally, and is responsible for the death of 50,000 Australians each year.

Recent outbreaks in Nicaragua and Brazil are timely reminders of the seriousness of disease caused by the Leptospira bacteria. In these outbreaks >10% of people developing the disease did not recover. Spread of the disease does not occur from person to person, but rather from animal to human. Leptospira are shed from infected animals via the urine; human infection may occur through contact with infected urine or urine contaminated materials. In Australia, leptospirosis is an occupational hazard with dairy farmers, pig handlers, banana pickers and abattoir workers being those most at risk. A recent and alarming development is the emergence of new risk groups associated with certain leisure activities. For example, in the USA three triathletes died from leptospirosis and it was subsequently determined that the source of infection was contaminated swimming water. This project will investigate aspects of the development of disease and immunity during infection by Leptospira. This will be achieved by analysing the set of proteins located on the surface of the bacterium. These proteins play a key role in the development of disease. Using state of the art technology, each of the proteins will be purified and identified.

The emphasis is to determine the mechanism by which this regulatory process is mediated. Research in this laboratory has identified two genes whose protein products are the key links in this regulatory network. The objectives of the project will be to determine which part of the regulatory protein interacts with the target toxin gene, to start to determine the structure of the regulatory protein so that the precise biochemical mechanism of action can be ascertained, to determine the components of the DNA target that are essential for binding activity, and to identify other genes that are involved in the regulation of both the toxin genes and other genes that may be implicated in the disease process. These studies will be facilitated by the availability of the complete genome sequence of this pathogenic bacterium. The project will make a major contribution to our knowledge of how bacteria that cause disease are able to control the production of the toxins that are critical to the disease process.

The kidneys play a critical role in control of blood pressure under normal conditions, and probably also in the initiation and maintenance of high blood pressure. This influence is exerted both through the excretion of salt and water, and by the release of substances into the circulation that affect blood pressure (hormones). Recent experiments performed by us and others have indicated that the inner part of the kidney (the medulla) is critical in these functions, which appear to be regulated by the level of blood flow in the medulla of the kidney. Our recent experiments also show that hormones and nerves have diverse effects on blood flow in the different regions of the kidney, showing that these factors can differentially affect blood pressure depending on their effects on medullary blood flow. Importantly, these hormones and nerves do not act in isolation, but act in concert, and in association with so called 'second messenger' systems that act locally to directly affect the contraction of muscle in blood vessels, and so blood vessel size. The experiments described in this application are aimed at determining how circulating and locally acting hormones, and the nerves in the kidney, interact together to control blood flow in the different regions of the kidney. This will help us understand how blood flow to the medulla of the kidney is regulated normally, so that we can begin to understand how malfunction of these systems can contribute to the development of high blood pressure.", "institutions": ["Monash University"], "researchers": ["A/Pr Simon Malpas", "Prof Roger Evans"], "status": "CLOSED", "fundingAmount": 410616.8, "fundingScheme": "NHMRC Project Grants", "startDate": 2001, "endDate": 2005, "dateTimeModified": "2017-07-11T08:35:15Z", "dateTimeCreated": "2013-05-15T16:45:40Z", "funder": ["National Health and Medical Research Council", "National Health and Medical Research Council (Australia)", "National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)"], "managingInstitution": ["Monash University", "Monash University", "Monash University"], "principalInvestigator": ["Prof Roger Evans"], "purl": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143603", "identifiers": ["http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/143603", "143603"], "subjects": ["Medical molecular engineering of nucleic acids and proteins", "Medical biotechnology", "BIOMEDICAL AND CLINICAL SCIENCES", "endothelium, vascular", "kidney cortex/blood supply", "kidney medulla/blood supply", "laser Doppler flowmetry", "sympathetic nervous system", "heart failure, congestive", "hypertension", "kidney failure", "kidney papillary necrosis"], "links": [{"rel": "self", "href": "http://researchdata.edu.au/api/v2.0/registry/activities/grants/97981"}]}, {"id": "112429", "key": "http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/1055116", "type": "grant", "title": "From the synchrotron to the clinic: translation of a novel functional lung imaging technology", "description": "Our team has recently developed a synchrotron technology with a startling capacity for dynamic functional imaging that can act as a sensitive regional indicator of lung disease.

Plaques contain amyloid protein and also have high levels of the essential metals copper and zinc. Copper is needed for the formation of these protein aggregations and increases the toxic effects of amyloid, leading to the idea that copper-binding chemicals could be used to treat Alzheimer s disease. However experiments in animal models have produced conflicting results, some suggesting that increased copper levels protect against neuronal damage while others claim the opposite effect. Comparison of these studies is hampered by the different experimental systems used. We will clarify the role of copper in the progression of Alzheimer s disease using a simple insect model, the fly Drosophila melanogaster. Production of amyloid in Drosophila neuronal tissues produces a neurodegenerative effect similar to that seen in human brains, but in a matter of weeks rather than the years required in humans. We will combine production of amyloid with production of copper uptake and export proteins to investigate the effect of changing copper levels. We will also test the effect of increasing copper and other metals in the diet to see whether dietary levels are an important factor in disease progression. Finally, we will use the Drosophila model to test large numbers of metal binding compounds and drugs for ones that slow or halt the neuronal damage caused by amyloid production, identifying potential therapeutics for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease.

Underlying the function of both blood cell types is their ability to stick (or adhere) to each other. However the way in which they coordinate this adhesion is very complex. New information from our laboratory has demonstrated that the sticky behaviour of each cell type is spatially and temporally regulated, and may involve may factors both inside and outside of the cells themselves. Our studies aim to define the key components regulating the 'stickiness' of these blood cells, in order to undertand how they contribute to maintaining healthy vessel walls, but also how their stickiness may also contribute to the promotion of diseased vessels.
